= Hello Mule Tutorial

To demonstrate how a Mule application interacts with a user in a simple HTTP
request-response flow, this example responds with the message "Hello Mule" to
requests submitted from a web browser.

Note that this is a very simple example. In a more
complex application, you can connect to external servers (such as SAP,
Salesforce, a database, or an FTP server), import and implement API
specifications directly within a Mule project, set up security, and process and
transform the data in programmatic ways. It is beyond the scope of this
example to explore such tasks.

You set up and run this application as a project in Anypoint Studio.

== Prerequisites

* xref:studio::to-download-and-install-studio.adoc[Studio 7]
* Familiarity with the Anypoint Studio UI (palette, canvas, flow), as documented
in xref:docs-studio::index.adoc[Anypoint Studio]

After Studio is installed, you can set up and run the example.

== How the Example Works

The Hello Mule example consists of one simple Mule flow. This flow accepts an
HTTP request, sets a static payload on the message, and then returns a response
to you.

The inbound HTTP endpoint receives requests that are submitted to the web service.
The HTTP endpoint is responsible for receiving and returning messages because
the message-exchange pattern is request-response.

As its name suggests, the Set Payload component sets a value in the message
payload. In this example, the value uses a DataWeave expression to set a static
string on the payload.


== Set Up the Example

Follow these steps to create the example in your own instance of Studio. Note that
you can create template applications in Studio and tweak the configurations
of the use case-based templates to create your own customized applications in
Mule.

. Create a project in Studio named "HelloMule" by selecting
*File* > *New* > *Mule Project*, providing the *Project Name*, and clicking
*Finish*.
+
Notice that the project name does not contain any blank spaces.
+
. In the project's *Mule Palette* tab, click *HTTP*, and drag the *Listener*
operation into the *Source* section of the *hellomuleFlow*.
. In the Studio canvas, click the *Listener* operation to open its configuration
UI in the *Listener* tab.
+
. In the listener's *Connector configuration* field, click *+*, use
*Test connection* to check that the default configuration works, and then click
*OK* to add the configuration to the project.
+
* If the connection is successful, you see the message "Test connection successful!"
in a *Test connection* dialog that pops up.
* If the connection fails, try using a port number that is not in use, such as
`8082` or `8083`, retest the connection, and then add the configuration.
+
. In the listener's *Path* field, type the path `/hellomule`.
+
The example uses this path in a web browser to trigger the listener.
+
. From the *Mule Palette* tab, click *Core*, and then find and drag a Set Payload
component to the *Process* area of the Studio canvas.
+
If you do not find the Set Payload component, try the search field at the top of the
*Mule Palette* tab.
+
. From the Studio canvas, click the Set Payload component to open its
configuration UI in the *Set Payload* tab.
. In the component's *Value* field, _deselect_ the *fx* field and type the
string `"Hello Mule!"` (including the quotation marks).
+
When you deselect *fx* the value contains only the string `Hello Mule`
_and does not contain_
a hash (`&#35;`) or square brackets (`[]`).
+
. From the *Mule Palette* tab, click *Core*, and then find and drag a Logger
component to the right of the Transform Message component.
+
If you do not find the Logger component, try the search field at the top of the
*Mule Palette* tab.
+
. From the Studio canvas, click the Logger component to open the configuration
UI in the *Logger* tab.
. In the logger's *Message* field, click the *fx* button and add the following
expression for printing the request path to the Studio console:
+
`attributes.requestPath`
+
. Save the project by selecting *File* > *Save* from Studio.
. Proceed to <<run_example>>.

[[run_example]]
== Run and Execute the Hello Mule Example

After setting up Hello Mule in Studio, you can run and test it.

. Run your *hellomule* app by right-clicking within the Studio canvas and
selecting *Run project hellomule*.
+
Alternatively, you can click the Run button (image:run_button.png[Run button,25px,15px])
located at the top of Studio, and select *hellomule* from the drop-down menu that
opens.
+
Either action launches the build process and opens the Studio console, where the
logs print important information about the two-stage build and deployment process.
+
If you receive a failure (`FAILED`) in the console that includes a message like
the one that follows, try setting a new HTTP port in your HTTP listener
configuration:
`Could not create server: A server in port(8081) already exists for host(0.0.0.0) or one overlapping it (0.0.0.0).`
Then save and rerun your project. Note that you can also try changing the host
to `localhost` if the failure persists.
+
The project is running if you see a message that ends something like this in the
Studio console:
+

*******************************************************************************
----
+
. After your application is running, open a browser window, and provide
the URL to the listener: for example, `+http://0.0.0.0:8081/hellomule+`.
+
You must use the same host and port as configured in the HTTP listener.
+
. Check for the message `Hello Mule!` in the browser.
. In Studio, notice that the message in the console includes the
request path (`/hellomule`) in the first `INFO` line, which ends
`org.mule.runtime.core.internal.processor.LoggerMessageProcessor: /hellomule`.


== Configuration XML for the Hello Mule Example

The following XML provides the flow and HTTP listener configuration for the
example. To reserve space, the example omits the `doc:id` attributes, which
are not required.

.Configuration XML from Studio:

<http:listener-config name="HTTP_Listener_config"
                      doc:name="HTTP Listener config" >
