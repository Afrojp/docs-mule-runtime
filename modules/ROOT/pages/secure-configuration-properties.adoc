Create secure configuration properties by encrypting them. To set up the encryption process:

. Obtain the Mule Secure Configuration Property Extension module from Exchange, as described in <<add-module>>.
. Configure a secure properties file with this module. This file must point to or include the decryption key.
. Define secure properties in any properties configuration file. Enclose the secured properties between the sequence `![value]`, as described in <<config-files-content>>. The same properties configuration file can include secured and non-secured properties.

[[add-module]]
== Adding the Secure Configuration Properties Module
The Mule Secure Configuration Property Extension module is available from https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/com.mulesoft.modules/mule-secure-configuration-property-module/[Exchange].

You can configure a secure properties file with this module (`<secure-properties:config>`), for example:

.Example: Secure Configuration Properties with Default Values
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<secure-properties:config key="${runtime.property}"
  file="file1.yaml" name="test">
    <secure-properties:encrypt/> <!--1-->
</secure-properties:config>

<global-property name="prop" value="my-${secure::property.key1}"/> <!--2-->
----
<1> The `<secure-properties:encrypt>` tag is required even when using the default values.
<2> The prefix `secure::` is required for loading the key.

In the example above:

* A decryption key is passed into the Mule runtime at deployment time as a system environment variable `runtime.property`. This property must be the exact key used to encrypt the values stored in the `file1.yaml` file.
* The default encryption algorithm and mode is used.
* If the actual (decrypted) value of the property `property.key1` is, for example, `"property"`, the value of the property `prop` will be `"my-property"`.

You can also change the encryption algorithm and crypto mode by setting additional attributes of the `<secure-properties:encrypt>` tag, for example:

.Example: Secure Configuration Properties with Custom Values
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<secure-properties:config key="${runtime.property}"
  file="file1.properties" name="test">
    <secure-properties:encrypt algorithm="AES" mode="CBC"/> <!--1-->
</secure-properties:config>
----
<1> This uses the `AES` algorithm with `CBC` mode.

[[supported_files]]
== Supported Files

The Secure Configuration Properties module supports both YAML configuration files and Spring-formatted properties files, as shown in the examples below. The recommended approach is to use a YAML configuration file, because it allows the addition of type validations and autocompletion.

[[config-files-content]]
=== Configuration Files Content

Both encrypted and non-encrypted values can be used anywhere in the Mule app. Encrypted values should be defined between the sequence `![value]`, as shown in the example below. The `file1.yaml` file can also contain non-encrypted values, for example:

.Example: file1.yaml
----
encrypted:
    value1: "![nHWo5JhNAYM+TzxqeHdRDXx15Q5R56YVGiQgXCoBCew=]"
    value2: "![nHWo6XyCADP+TzxqeHdRDXx15Q5R56YVGiQgXCoDFaj=]"

testPropertyA: "testValueA"
testPropertyB: "testValueB"
----

[NOTE]
The encrypted value must be enclosed in quotes so that it is read as a String.

Here is the same configuration as above using a Spring-formatted properties file:

.Example: file1.properties
----
encrypted.value1=![nHWo5JhNAYM+TzxqeHdRDXx15Q5R56YVGiQgXCoBCew=]
encrypted.value2=![nHWo6XyCADP+TzxqeHdRDXx15Q5R56YVGiQgXCoDFaj=]

testPropertyA=testValueA
testPropertyB=testValueB
----

== Usage

Here is a flow that uses the encrypted `encrypted.value1` value to set the payload:

.Example: Use of Secure Property
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<flow name="main">
    <set-payload value="${secure::encrypted.value1}"/>
</flow>
----
At runtime, the decryption algorithm is used to store the decrypted value of `encrypted.value1` into memory.

Here is a flow that uses a non-encrypted value from the same secure properties file:

.Example: Use of Non-encrypted Properties
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<flow name="mainNonEncrypted">
    <set-payload value="${secure::testPropertyA}"/>
</flow>
----

Notice that you have to use the `secure::` prefix to access all values inside a secure properties file, even if the values are non-encrypted. This behavior allows you to switch between files (or environments) without changing the entire configuration.

=== Setting the Properties File Dynamically

A common configuration use case is to set the file to depend on a property (for example, `env`) to determine which file to use. For example, to use a `development-properties` file in development stage (which could not be encrypted) or a production file (with encrypted values).

.Example: Secure Configuration Properties with Environment File Defined
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<secure-properties:config key="${runtime.property}" file="${env}-properties.yaml" name="test"/>
----

This way, the value of the property `env` determines which file to use to load the secure configuration properties. That `env` property could be set by a `global property`, system property, or environment property (see xref:configuring-properties.adoc[Configure Properties]).

.Example: Secure Configuration Properties with Environment File Defined
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<global-property name="env" value="dev"/>

<secure-properties:config key="${runtime.property}" file="${env}-properties.yaml" name="test"/>
----

This way, the default value for the `env` property will be `"dev"`, which can still be overriden with a system or environment property. Please note that this is *required* for metadata resolution in Anypoint Studio. If you do not define devault values for the properties that are passed through the command line you will receive an error while creating application model for all message processors that depend on them.

=== Working with More than One Configuration File

You can define more than one secure configuration properties file to read properties from. To do so, simply define a `<secure-properties:config />` tag for each file you want to load. Each secure configuration properties file is independently configured with an encryption algorithm, cipher mode, and encryption/decryption key. None of these settings needs to be the same between secure configuration properties files.

.Using More Than One Config File
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<secure-properties:config key="${runtime.property}" file="file1.yaml" name="test">
    <secure-properties:encrypt algorithm="AES" mode="CBC"/>
</secure-properties:config>

<secure-properties:config key="${runtime.property}" file="file2.yaml" name="otherConfig">
    <secure-properties:encrypt algorithm="AES" mode="CBC"/>
</secure-properties:config>
----

== File Level Encryption

Since version 1.1.0 of the Secure Configuration Properties module, you can encrypt the entire file (not only the values of the properties). To use a file that its encrypted, you add the `fileLevelEncryption` attribute and set it to `true`:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<secure-properties:config key="${runtime.property}" file="file1.yaml" fileLevelEncryption="true" name="test">
    <secure-properties:encrypt algorithm="AES" mode="CBC"/>
</secure-properties:config>
----

To encrypt a file content, see <<secure_props_tool>>.

[[qanda]]
=== Frequently Asked Questions

*What if a property is defined in multiple files?*

In that case, the actual property's value will be the one in which is first defined.

*What if I want to define a secure property to depend on a previously defined secure property?*

It is possible to define a property to depend on a previously defined one, just using the same syntax: `property=My dependent ${secure::dependent.property} value`.

Note that Secure Configuration Properties can depend on other Secure Configuration Properties, but not on other Mule configuration properties (see xref:configuring-properties.adoc[Configure Properties]).

== Warning

When using encrypted properties, it is especially important to **secure access to the operating system**. Anyone who can run a `ps` command or view a Java console will be able to see the decrypted values that are stored in the Mule app's memory.

[[secure_props_tool]]
== Secure Properties Tool

You can download the https://docs.mulesoft.com/downloads/mule-runtime/4.2/secure-properties-tool.jar[JAR file] for this tool to perform encryption or decryption operations.

This tool supports encrypting a text string, the values inside a properties file, or all the content of a properties file.

See <<parameter-reference>> for a complete list and definition of all accepted parameters.

=== Encrypt Single Values

Use the following syntax to encrypt or decrypt a text string provided as a parameter:

[source,console.linenums]
----
java -jar secure-properties-tool.jar \
<method> \
<operation> \
<algorithm> \
<mode> \
<key> \
<value>
----

* Set `<method>` to `string` to configure the tool to process a text string. +
* Specify the other parameters to perform your desired operation.

For example, if you run:

[source,console.linenums]
----
java -jar secure-properties-tool.jar \
string \
encrypt \
Blowfish \
CBC \
mulesoft \
"some value to encrypt"
----

The tool returns:

[source,console.linenums]
----
8q5e1+jy0cND2iV2WPThahmz6XsDwB6Z
----

=== Encrypt Files

In addition to processing strings, the encryption tool processes `.yaml` or `.properties` files. You can encrypt or decrypt the values inside a properties file, or all the file's content.

==== Encrypt Properties Inside a File

Use the following syntax to encrypt or decrypt all values inside a properties file:

[source,console.linenums]
----
java -jar secure-properties-tool.jar \
<method> \
<operation> \
<algorithm> \
<mode> \
<key> \
<input file> \
<output file>
----

* Set `<method>` to `file`. +
* Set `<input file>` to the properties file to process. +
* Set `<output file>` to the file that is generated after the process. +
* Specify the other parameters to perform your desired operation.

For example, consider the file `example_in.yaml` with the following content:
[source,yaml,linenums]
----
properties:
  example1:
    value: "Muleman is here"
  example2: "Max the mule"
----

If you run:
[source,console.linenums]
----
java -jar secure-properties-tool.jar \
file \
encrypt \
Blowfish \
CBC \
mulesoft \
example_in.yaml \
example_out.yaml
----

The tool generates the file `example_out.yaml` with the following content:
[source,yaml,linenums]
----
properties:
  example1:
    value: "![qCReIPK3jcqD7WR84ISSIQ==]"
  example2: "![En8lII21ZHrdIaINw0+mSA==]"
----

==== Encrypt All the Content of a File

Use the following syntax to encrypt or decrypt all the content of a properties file:

[source,console.linenums]
----
java -jar secure-properties-tool.jar \
<method> \
<operation> \
<algorithm> \
<mode> \
<key> \
<input file> \
<output file>
----

* Set `<method>` to `file-level`. +
* Set `<input file>` to the properties file to process. +
* Set `<output file>` to the file that is generated after the process. +
* Specify the other parameters to perform your desired operation.

For example, consider the file `example_in.yaml` with the following content:
[source,yaml,linenums]
----
properties:
  example1:
    value: "Muleman is here"
  example2: "Max the mule"
----

If you run:
[source,console.linenums]
----
java -jar secure-properties-tool.jar \
file-level \
encrypt \
Blowfish \
CBC \
mulesoft \
example_in.yaml \
example_out.yaml
----

The tool generates the file `example_out.yaml` with the following content:
[source,txt,linenums]
----
