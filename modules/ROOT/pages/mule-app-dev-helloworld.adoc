= Hello Mule Tutorial

To demonstrate a simple HTTP request-response flow, this example responds
with the message "Hello Mule" to requests submitted from a Web browser.
The example demonstrates how a Mule application interacts with a user over an
HTTP request.

You set up and run this application as a project in Anypoint Studio. In a more
complex application, it is possible to do much more than this simple example
shows. For example, you can connect to external servers (such as SAP,
Salesforce, a database, or an FTP server), import and implement API
specifications directly within a Mule project, set up security, and process and
transform the data in programmatic ways. It is beyond the scope of this
example to explore such tasks.

== Prerequisites

xref:7.3@studio::to-download-and-install-studio.adoc[Studio 7] is required.

Once Studio is installed, you can set up and run the example. The example
assumes that you have basic familiarity with the Studio UI, including
the Mule Palette and the Studio canvas, where you drag and drop Mule components
and connector operations into a Mule flow. If you do not, review these topics
in the Studio overview, xref:7.3@docs-studio::index.adoc[Anypoint Studio].

== How the Example Works

The Hello Mule example consists of one simple Mule flow. This flow accepts an
HTTP request, sets a static payload on the message, and then returns a response
to you.

The request-response inbound HTTP endpoint receives requests the end user
submits to the Web service. Because the message-exchange pattern is
request-response, this HTTP endpoint is responsible for both receiving and
returning messages. The descriptive notes included in the configuration of the
endpoint can help you understand the actions the endpoint performs.

As its name suggests, the Set Payload component sets a value in the message
payload. In this example, the value utilizes a Mule expression to set a static
string on the payload. Like the HTTP endpoint, the configuration contains
descriptive notes to help you understand what the component does.


== Set Up the Example

Follow these steps to create example in your own instance of Studio. Note that
you can create template applications in Studio and tweak the configurations
of the use case-based templates to create your own customized applications in
Mule.

. Create a project in Studio named "HelloMule" by selecting
*File* > *New* > *Mule Project*, providing the *Project Name*, and clicking
*Finish*.
+
Notice that the project name does not contain any blank spaces.
+
. In the project's *Mule Palette* tab, click *HTTP*, and drag the *Listener*
operation into the the *Source* section of the *hellomuleFlow*.
. In the Studio canvas, click the *Listener* to open its configuration UI in
its *Listener* tab.
+
. In the listener's *Connector configuration* field, click the *+*, use
*Test connection* to check that the default configuration works, and then click
*OK* to add the configuration to the project.
+
* If the connection is successful, you see the message "Test connection successful!"
in a *Test connection* dialog that pops up.
* If the connection fails, try using a port number that is not in use, such as
`8082` or `8083`, retest the connection, and then add the configuration.
+
. In the listener's *Path* field, type the path `/hellomule`.
+
The example uses this path in a web browser to trigger the listener.
+
. From the *Mule Palette*, click *Core*, and then find and drag a Set Payload
component to the *Process* area of the Studio canvas.
+
If you do not find *Set Payload*, try the search field at the top of the
*Mule Palette*.
+
. From the Studio canvas, click the Set Payload component to open its
configuration UI in its *Set Payload* tab.
. In the component's *Value* field, _deselect_ the *fx* field, and type the
string `Hello Mule!`, surrounded by quotes.
+
When you deselect *fx* the value only contains the string `Hello Mule`
_and does not contain_
a hash or square brackets.
+
. From the *Mule Palette*, click *Core*, and then find and drag a Logger
component to the right of the Transform Message component.
+
If you do not find *Logger*, try the search field at the top of the
*Mule Palette*.
+
. From the Studio canvas, click the Logger component to open its configuration
UI in its *Logger* tab.
. In the logger's *Message* field, click the *fx* button, and add the following
expression for printing the request path to the Studio console.
+
`attributes.requestPath`
+
. Save the project by selecting *File* -> *Save* from Studio.
. Proceed to <<run_example>>.

[[run_example]]
== Run and Execute the Hello Mule Example

After setting up Hello Mule in Studio, you can run and test it.

. Run your *hellomule* app by right-clicking within the Studio canvas and
selecting *Run project hellomule*.
+
Alternatively, you can click Run button (image:run_button.png[Run button,25px,15px])
located at the top of Studio, and select *hellomule* from the drop-down menu that
opens.
+
Either action launches the build process and opens the Studio console, where the
logs print important information about the two-stage build and deployment process.
+
If you receive a failure (`FAILED`) in the console that includes a message like
the one that follows, try setting a new HTTP port in your HTTP listener
configuration:
`Could not create server: A server in port(8081) already exists for host(0.0.0.0) or one overlapping it (0.0.0.0).`
Then save and rerun your project. Note that you can also try changing the host
to `localhost` if the failure persists.
+
The project is running if you see a message that ends something like this in the
Studio console:
+

*          - - + DOMAIN + - -   * - - + STATUS + - - *

*******************************************************************************
----
+
. Once your application is running, open a browser window, and provide load
the URL to the listener, for example, `+http://0.0.0.0:8081/hellomule+`.
+
You must use the same host and port that is configured in the HTTP listener.
+
. Check for the following message in the browser: `Hello Mule!`
. In the Studio, notice that the message in the console includes the
request path (`/hellomule`) in the first `INFO` line, which ends
`org.mule.runtime.core.internal.processor.LoggerMessageProcessor: /hellomule`.


== Configuration XML for the Hello Mule Example

The following XML provides the flow and HTTP listener configuration for the
example. To reserve space, the example omits the `doc:id` attributes, which
are not required.

.Configuration XML from Studio:

[source,XML,linenums]
----
<http:listener-config name="HTTP_Listener_config"
                      doc:name="HTTP Listener config" >
  <http:listener-connection host="0.0.0.0" port="8081" />
</http:listener-config>
<flow name="hello-muleFlow" >
  <http:listener doc:name="Listener"
