If you plan to install Mule and run it on premises, review these minimum hardware and software requirements before you install.

== Minimum Hardware Requirements

* 2 GHz CPU or 1 virtual CPU in virtualized environments
* 1 GB of RAM. Add RAM to match your latency requirements, or to support large simultaneous messages or a large number of simultaneous messages if your applications process them.
* 4 GB of storage

== Supported Software and Systems

Verify that you use a supported version of Java and a supported operating system before you install Mule.

Mule Runtime runs as a standalone server; therefore an application server is not required. However, if you use an application server or need to access a data store, verify that you use a supported application server or database.

If you use the Microsoft Dynamics GP connector, install Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) 8 after installing JRE or JDK.

The unified Mule Runtime 4.1.5 and API Gateway is compatible with APIkit 1.1.8.

This version of Mule Runtime is bundled with the Runtime Manager Agent plugin version 2.1.9.

Anypoint Connector DevKit 3.9.5 is compatible with Mule Runtime versions 4.1 and later. DevKit version numbering does not correspond to Mule versions. For example, DevKit 3.9 is compatible with Mule versions 3.5-4.1. For the latest fixes and improvements, use the current version of Mule Runtime with its corresponding DevKit as listed in release notes.
