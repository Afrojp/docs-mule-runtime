If you're deploying multiple applications as a shared resource, do not set any properties in the project properties files. This might cause conflicts among the various applications that share a domain. Instead, set environment variables over the scope of the deployed application, its domain, and other applications under that domain.

Environment variables set in Studio are only used when you deploy using the Mule runtime engine within Studio.

When you deploy applications on-premises, set the environment variables from the command line when you start the Mule instance.

== Set Environment Variables in Anypoint Studio

Follow these steps:

. Open the dropdown menu next to the Play button and select *Run Configurations...*.

. Select the corresponding Run configuration. If a Run configuration does not exist for your project, you can create one by using the New launch configuration button:
+
image::run-configurations-2.png[run-configurations-2]

. Select the *Environment* tab, and add the variables you need.

+
The environment variables you create are defined at the domain level. These will affect all of the applications associated with that domain when you deploy locally using Studio.

Environment variables only work when you run the application in the Mule runtime engine within Studio. This configuration does not affect design time operations such as DataSense, automatic completion, or validation.

== Set Environment Variables for On-Premises Deployments

Append `-M-Dmule.<variable-name>=<value>` to the `mule start` command to set an environment variable. +
Replace `<variable-name>` with your desired variable name. +
Replace `<value>` with the value to define for the variable.

The following example starts Mule and defines two variables with different values:

----
$ mule start -M-Dmule.myEnv=prod -M-Dmule.myValue=1234
----
