Mule Runtime (or Mule) is a lightweight integration engine that runs Mule apps.
Rather than creating multiple point-to-point integrations between systems,
services, APIs, and devices, Mule apps manage message routing, data mapping,
orchestration, reliability, security, and scalability between nodes.

== Event-Driven Architecture

Mule works by responding to events that are initiated by external or internal
resources. Mule supports a variety of listeners, as well as internally
triggered events based on intervals set in a scheduler. Some schedulers can
poll for specific changes to external resources, such as new files or table
rows in an external resource. This behavior reflects Mule's event-driven
architecture (EDA).

* Mule apps accept and process events as messages through Event processors.
Mule apps can also handle large messages in batches through Batch processing
components.
* Event processing components are arranged into a flow (or several of them).

For more on this topic, see xref:about-mule-event.adoc[Mule Events].

== Flows

Understanding basic flow architecture is key to understanding Mule.
Essentially, every Mule flow contains a series of components that can
receive or process messages, as well as other parts of the Mule event.

.Simple Flow in Design Center

At the simplest level, flows are sequences of Event processors. A message
that enters a flow can pass through a variety of processors. In a typical
flow, a Mule app receives a message through an Event source (an endpoint, such
as an HTTP listener), transforms that message into a new format, and processes
any business logic before writing the processed message to an external system
in a format that the system can read.

//TODO: VERIFY INFO ON WAYS FLOW CAN CALL OTHER FLOWS
Mule apps often contain multiple flows, which you link and combine together
to perform the integration required for your use cases. A flow can call
another flow as a direct reference, or it can call a flow through a common
communication protocol or method, such as JMS, HTTP, FTP, or File. The called
flows might be part of the same Mule app or might run in a separate deployment
on another Mule runtime across the network.

For more on this topic, see xref:about-flows[Flows and Subflows] and
xref:mule-application-about.adoc[Mule Applications].

=== Event sources

External clients can trigger processing in a Mule flow through a number of
communication protocols and methods, such as JMS, HTTP, FTP, JDBC, or File.
Mule translates these communication protocols or method into a standard
Message format, which passes through the flow's Event processors.

An Event source (or Trigger component) is the first processor in a flow. This
processor receives a triggering event and creates a corresponding Mule event
object to forward to the next event processing component in the flow.

Event sources in Mule can provide connectivity to a specific external source,
either through a standard protocol or a third-party API. Here are some examples:

* HTTP request
* JMS message
* Salesforce publish
* File poller
* Scheduler

Note that you can also create your own Event source using the
xref:1.1@mule-sdk::index.adoc[Mule SDK].

== Event Processors

Once a flow is triggered through an Event source, subsequent components process
the Mule event as it travels through the flow. By default, each Event processor
that receives a Mule event returns a new Mule message, typically with the set
of attributes and message payload that the processor returns. The processor
passes on the new message as output to the next processor in the flow.

Event processors that are available for use in Mule apps include:

* Operations from modules and connectors. Examples include reading from and
writing to an external resource and validating data in the Mule app.
+
Some operations can make client requests to external resources and services
(including external databases and systems, such as Salesforce, Workday,
ServiceNow, and many others) and to other Mule apps. Others can perform
validations or run your custom code, for example. A number of other operations
are available.
+
* Core components. Examples include routing data, performing data
transformations, and handling errors that might occur when processing the event.
+
Transformers (such as the Transform Message, Set Variable, and others) are
key to exchanging data between nodes. Transformers allow Mule to convert message
data in the Mule event to a format that another application or service can read.
+
Mule also enables content enrichment of messages (through
xref:target-variables[Target Parameters]) so that you can retrieve
additional data and attach it to the message.

Generally speaking, event processing components process business logic, such as
checking customer and inventory databases. These components route messages to the
correct application, such as an order fulfillment system. Importantly,
event processors do not necessarily require Mule-specific code. For example,
MuleSoft provides event processing components that support POJOs, Spring beans,
Java beans, Groovy scripts, and web services that contain the business logic
for processing data. It is also possible to develop custom modules to
support other languages, such as Python, JavaScript, Ruby, or PHP. MuleSoft's
catalog event processing components support the most commonly used
Enterprise Integration Patterns.

Some event processors provide ways to filter source data (such as files or
email) so that you only deal with the data that your use cases require. Some
event processors also serve as scopes that "wrap" around other event
processors and cache the result of their processing. You can use routers to
send messages on different paths in your app, depending on the content of
the message payload.

Within many of the fields of the message processors of your flow, you can use
<<dataweave>> expressions and scripts to extract information
about the message or its environment and instruct Mule to make processing
decisions based on that information.

=== Anypoint Studio and Design Center

You can design Mule apps in Anypoint Studio, in Design Center, or even with
handwritten XML. Studio and Design Center UIs represent message processors as
icons within flow components. Studio also represents them as XML elements in a
Configuration XML.

The example below is a simple flow created in Anypoint Studio's visual editor;
click the *XML Editor* tab to view the XML of a Mule project that holds the same
flow.

[[dataweave]]
== DataWeave

DataWeave is the primary language used for formulating expressions in Mule. You
use DataWeave to access, manipulate, transform, and use data from the message and
its environment.

At runtime, Mule evaluates expressions while executing a flow to:

* Extract data needed to process the current message.
* Set or manipulate a value in the message.
* Perform an operation on data in the message.
//* Perform an operation on data in the message, application, Mule instance, or server.

For more on this topic, see xref:dataweave.adoc[DataWeave Language].

== Batch Processing

Studio and Design Center support batch jobs, which split messages into
individual records, act on each record, then report the results and, if
necessary, push the processed output to other systems or queues. This
functionality is particularly useful when working with streaming input or
when engineering "near real-time" data integration between SaaS applications.

For more on this topic, see xref:batch-processing-concept.adoc[Batch Processors].

== Non-blocking Execution Engine

The Mule execution engine is based on a non-blocking runtime. This is a
task-oriented execution model that allows you to take advantage of non-blocking
IO calls and to avoid performance problems.

Flows always function synchronously. If you need to achieve asynchronous
patterns, such as Fire-and-Forget, you can use the Async (`<async>`) component.

Each Mule Event processor can inform the runtime if it is CPU intensive,
CPU light, or an IO intensive operation. This helps the runtime self-tune
for different workloads dynamically, removing the need for you to manage
thread pools manually to achieve optimum performance.

=== Thread Pool Executor (Schedulers) Configuration

You can configure schedulers (thread pool executors) through the
well-commented `schedulers.conf` file in the standalone Mule EE
installation.
