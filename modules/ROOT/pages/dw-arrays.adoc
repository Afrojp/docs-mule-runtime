= Arrays (dw::core::Arrays)

This module contains helper functions for working with arrays.

To use this module, you must import it to your DataWeave code, for example,
by adding the line `import * from dw::core::Arrays` to the header of your
DataWeave script.

| Name  | Description
| xref:dw-arrays-functions-countby.adoc[countBy] | Counts the elements in a list (array) that match the results of a function.
| xref:dw-arrays-functions-divideby.adoc[divideBy] | Breaks up a list (array) into sub-lists (sub-arrays) that contain the
specified number of elements.
| xref:dw-arrays-functions-drop.adoc[drop] | Drops first `n` elements. It returns the original array when `n <= 0` and an empty array when `n > sizeOf(array)`.
| xref:dw-arrays-functions-dropwhile.adoc[dropWhile] | Drops elements from the array while the condition is met.
| xref:dw-arrays-functions-every.adoc[every] | Returns `true` if every element in the array matches the condition.
| xref:dw-arrays-functions-indexof.adoc[indexOf] | Returns the index of the first occurrence of an element within the array.
| xref:dw-arrays-functions-indexwhere.adoc[indexWhere] | Returns the index of the first occurrence of an element that matches a condition within the array.
| xref:dw-arrays-functions-join.adoc[join] | Joins two array of objects by a given `ID` criteria.
It will return an Array of object containing only the ones that the `ID` of the `left` can be matched with an `ID` of the `right`.
| xref:dw-arrays-functions-leftjoin.adoc[leftJoin] | Joins two array of objects by a given `ID` criteria.
It will return an Array all the `left` items merged by `ID` with the right items in the case where it exists any.
| xref:dw-arrays-functions-outerjoin.adoc[outerJoin] | Joins two array of objects by a given `ID` criteria.
It will return an Array with all the `left` items merged by `ID` with the `left` items in the case where it exists any, and the `right` items that are not present in the `left`
| xref:dw-arrays-functions-partition.adoc[partition] | Separates the array into the elements that satisfy the condition and those which don't.
| xref:dw-arrays-functions-slice.adoc[slice] | Selects the interval of elements that satisfy the condition: from <= indexOf(array) < until
| xref:dw-arrays-functions-some.adoc[some] | Returns `true` if an element in the array matches the specified condition.
| xref:dw-arrays-functions-splitat.adoc[splitAt] | Splits an array into two at a given position.
| xref:dw-arrays-functions-splitwhere.adoc[splitWhere] | Splits an array into two at the first position where the condition is met.
| xref:dw-arrays-functions-sumby.adoc[sumBy] | Returns the sum of the values of the elements in an array.
| xref:dw-arrays-functions-take.adoc[take] | Selects first `n` elements. It returns an empty array when `n <= 0` and the original array when `n > sizeOf(array)`.
| xref:dw-arrays-functions-takewhile.adoc[takeWhile] | Takes elements for the array while the condition is met.
