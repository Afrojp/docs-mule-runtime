= Migrating Transports

Mule 3 transports have been replaced by connectors, which follow an
operation model in Mule 4. Most Mule transports are replaceable by a
corresponding connector in Mule 4.

Some migration issues are common to all transports. For transport-specific
migration documentation, refer to
xref:migration-connectors.adoc[Migrating Connectors and Modules to Mule 4] and
its child pages, instead.

[[address]]
== Endpoint Addresses

In Mule 3, an endpoint could be configured with either transport-specific attributes (for example, an HTTP endpoint could use `host`, `port`, and `path`) or with the generic `address` attribute.

Whenever the generic `address` attribute was used, it was possible to reference a property,
for example:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<http:inbound-endpoint address="${External.URL}"/>
----

The properties configuration for `External.URL` looks something like this:

[source,text,linenums]
----
External.URL=http://0.0.0.0:8080/rootPath
----

In Mule 4, the connectors define the connection attributes separately, so any full address property has to be split into its components.

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<http:listener-config name="listenerConfig">
    <http:listener-connection host="${External.URL.host}" port="${External.URL.port}"/>
</http:listener-config>

<flow>
    <http:listener config-ref="listenerConfig" path="${External.URL.path}"/>

    ...
</flow>
----

The configuration for the properties becomes:

[source,text,linenums]
----
External.URL.host=0.0.0.0
External.URL.port=8080
External.URL.path=/rootPath
----

Connector-specific documentation (such as for the HTTP or Email connector)
provides detail on the exact properties that the connector requires.

[[service_overrides]]
== Service Overrides

In Mule 4, service override customizations through custom Java code are not
supported in Mule 4.

In Mule 3, it is possible to customize the behavior of a transport through a
connector's `service-overrides` element. This element provides a way to
reference  Java classes with custom code that provides the new functionality.

.Mule 3 Example: Connector with `service-overrides`
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<imap:connector name="imapConnector" moveToFolder="processed" deleteReadMessages="false" checkFrequency="200">
    <service-overrides messageReceiver="org.mule.transport.email.functional.RetrieveMessageReceiverPollCounter"/>
</imap:connector>
----

The way to migrate such customizations to Mule 4 depends on what the custom
code does, so you might:

* Provide the functionality through another Mule feature or component, such as
a xref:dataweave.adoc[DataWeave] transformation,
a xref:connectors::java/java-module.adoc[Java Module],
or a xref:connectors::scripting/scripting-module.adoc[Scripting Module]).
* Create a new connector based on the replacement of the modified transport
with the custom code added. This approach requires working with the SDK that
is used to implement a new connector for Mule 4 (see
xref:1.1@mule-sdk::index.adoc[Mule SDK]). As a starting point, you can use
open-source connectors as dependencies.
* Similar to the previous approach, you can fork the connector and add the
custom code there. MuleSoft welcome Pull Requests for that change.
* Provide a feature request to MuleSoft. You can request that MuleSoft add the
functionality that your custom code provided through `service-overrides`. Visit
https://support.mulesoft.com/s/ideas[MuleSoft Support Ideas] to submit such
requests.
