= Migrating Transports

The transports in Mule 3 have been replaced by connectors that follow an operation model in Mule 4. Most transports are
replaceable by a connector in Mule 4.

This page addresses items of migration that are common to all transports. For transport-specific migration
documentation, refer to xref:migration-connectors.adoc[Migrating Connectors and Modules to Mule 4] and its child pages.

[[service_overrides]]
== Service Overrides

In Mule 3, the behavior of a transport could be customized via a `service-overrides` inside the connector, which
references Java classes with custom code to provide the new functionality.

.Mule 3 Example: Connector with `service-overrides`
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<imap:connector name="imapConnector" moveToFolder="processed" deleteReadMessages="false" checkFrequency="200">
    <service-overrides messageReceiver="org.mule.transport.email.functional.RetrieveMessageReceiverPollCounter"/>
</imap:connector>
----

In Mule 4, this kind of customization through custom Java code is not supported. There are three possible approaches
that can be taken to migrate such scenario, depending on what the custom code is actually doing:

* Replace it with some other feature of Mule or another component (i.e.: xref:connectors::java/java-module.adoc[Java Module]
or xref:connectors::scripting/scripting-module.adoc[Scripting Module]) that provides a similar functionality.
* Create a new connector based on the replacement of the modified transport with the custom code added. This will
require working with the SDK that was used to implemented the new connector for Mule 4. Refer to xref:1.1@mule-sdk::index.adoc[Mule SDK]. Open Source connectors may be used as dependencies in order to have a starting point.
to get started with the Mule SDKs.
//* Going through product management to add support for what the custom code does
