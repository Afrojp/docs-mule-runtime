Before downloading and installing Mule runtime, verify that you have Java SE JDK 1.8 installed, for example:

[source,console,linenums]
----
$ java -version
java version "1.8.0_111"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_111-b14)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.111-b14, mixed mode)

== Downloading Mule

. Download the Mule 4 binary file from the Download Site and unzip it:
+
https://support.mulesoft.com/s/downloads[https://support.mulesoft.com/s/downloads]
+
The Mule 4 binary files are located under *Downloads* > *Mule Runtime* on the Download Site.
+
. Set an environment variable called `MULE_HOME` for the `mule` directory inside your extracted folder.
+
Example for version 4.1.5 in the `Downloads` directory:
+
* On Windows environments:
+
[source,console]
----
$ env:MULE_HOME=C:\Downloads\mule-enterprise-standalone-4.1.5\
----
+
* On Linux/Unix environments:
+
[source,console]
----
$ export MULE_HOME=~/Downloads/mule-enterprise-standalone-4.1.5/
----

== Running Mule

You can test if the Mule Runtime runs in your system without errors by running the following commands:

* On Windows environments:
+
[source,powershell]
----
$ $MULE_HOME\bin\mule.bat
----

* On Linux/Unix environments:
+
[source,console]
----
$ $MULE_HOME/bin/mule
----

These commands run Mule in foreground mode, the startup script displays information on the terminal’s standard output. You can’t issue further commands on the terminal as long as Mule is running.

To stop Mule, press `CTRL-C` in the terminal in which the script is running.

== Starting Mule as a Windows Service

To run Mule as a Windows service, you need to install it first by running:

[source,powershell]
----
$ $MULE_HOME\bin\mule.bat install
----

Once installed, you can run Mule as a service:

[source,powershell]
----
$ $MULE_HOME\bin\mule.bat start
----

== Starting Mule as a Linux/Unix Daemon

To run Mule as a Linux-Unix Daemon, you need to install it first by running:

[source,console]
----
$ $MULE_HOME/bin/mule install
----

Once installed, you can run Mule as a daemon:

[source,console]
----
$ $MULE_HOME/bin/mule start
----

[NOTE]
====
You can also start Mule without executing the installation step. This will start the Mule in the background for the current user session.
====

This example starts Mule from a Unix console:

[source,console,linenums]
----
$ $MULE_HOME/bin/mule start
MULE_HOME is set to ~/Downloads/mule-enterprise-standalone-4.1.5
MULE_BASE is set to ~/Downloads/mule-enterprise-standalone-4.1.5
Starting Mule Enterprise Edition...
Waiting for Mule Enterprise Edition.................
running: PID:87318
----

== Deploying Mule Applications

. Start Mule.
. After Mule runtime boots, you can deploy your Mule applications by moving your packaged JAR files to the `apps` directory in `$MULE_HOME`.

== Stopping Mule

Use the `stop` command to stop the Mule runtime.

This example stops Mule from a Unix console:

[source,console,linenums]
----
$ $MULE_HOME/bin/mule stop
MULE_HOME is set to /Applications/mule-enterprise-standalone-4.1.5
MULE_BASE is set to /Applications/mule-enterprise-standalone-4.1.5
Stopping Mule Enterprise Edition...
Stopped Mule Enterprise Edition.
----

== Removing the Mule Service or Daemon

Use the `remove` command to remove the service or daemon from your system.

This example removes the Mule daemon from a Unix console:

[source,console,linenums]
----
$ $MULE_HOME/bin/mule remove
MULE_HOME is set to /Applications/mule-enterprise-standalone-4.1.5
MULE_BASE is set to /Applications/mule-enterprise-standalone-4.1.5
Detected Mac OSX:
Mule Enterprise Edition is not running.
Removing Mule Enterprise Edition daemon...

You can remove the Mule service or daemon from your system by running the following:

* On Windows environments:
+
[source,powershell]
----
$ $MULE_HOME\bin\mule.bat remove
----

* On Linux/Unix environments:
+
[source,console]
----
$ $MULE_HOME/bin/mule remove
----

== Enable Anypoint Monitoring

Optionally, you can xref:monitoring::am-installing.adoc[install Anypoint Monitoring] for cloud-managed supported versions of on-premises runtimes so you can monitor applications running on that server.
