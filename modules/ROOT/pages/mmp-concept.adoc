= Mule Maven Plugin Deployment
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]
include::_attributes.adoc[]
endif::[]

The Mule Maven plugin enables you to integrate the packaging, testing, and deployment of your Mule applications with your Maven lifecycle. +
See xref:package-a-mule-application.adoc[Package a Mule Application] for packaging instructions.

With the plugin, you can deploy your Mule application to different deployment targets, such as standalone Mule instances, clustered instances, and CloudHub.

The Mule Maven plugin is compatible with Mule runtime engine(Enterprise Edition) and with Mule Kernel (Community Edition).

== Compatibility

* Mule 4.x
* Anypoint Studio 7.x

== Mule Maven Plugin Goals

The Mule Maven plugin has three goals:

* `package` +
Generates the jar file for your project. See xref:package-a-mule-application.adoc#package-goal[Package Goal] for details.
* `deploy` +
Automatically uploads and starts your application in any of the application deployment targets (CloudHub, Runtime Fabric, or On-Premises).
* `mule:undeploy` +
Automatically removes your application from any of the application deployment targets (CloudHub, Runtime Fabric, or On-Premises).

Each goal accepts parameters that are unique to the desired plugin behavior.
To provide a parameter from the command line, prepend `-D` to the parameter name.

=== Deploy Goal

This goal uploads and deploys the application JAR file to any of the application deployment targets. The deploy goal binds by default to the http://maven.apache.org/ref/3.6.1/maven-core/lifecycles.html[Maven lifecycle phase]: `deploy`.

Optional Parameters
[%header%autowidth.spread,cols="a,a,a"]
|===
|Name | Type | Description
|`artifact` | String | Path to the application JAR file to be deployed. By default is set to the application `target` folder.
|`muleDeploy` | boolean | Instructs the plugin to deploy using the deployment strategy defined in the plugin configuration. If the `muleDeploy` parameter is not set, the plugin uploads the artifacts to the repository defined in the `distributionManagement` section of the application's `pom.xml` file.
|===

For example, to execute the `deploy` goal and set the `muleDeploy` parameter, you run the following command:
[source,console,linenums]
----
mvn deploy -DmuleDeploy
----

=== Undeploy Goal

This goal removes an application from any of the application deployment targets. It uses the information from the plugin configuration to remove the application from the defined deployment target.

To execute the `undeploy` goal, run the following command:
[source,console,linenums]
----
mvn mule:undeploy
----

The undeploy goal also deletes the app in Mule Maven plugin 3.3.0 and later versions.

== Add the Mule Maven Plugin to a Mule Project

include::partial$mmp-concept.adoc[tag=addMuleMavenPluginToAProject]

== Mule Application Deployment

The Mule Maven plugin allows you to automate the deployment of your Mule application to any of the application deployment targets (CloudHub, Runtime Fabric, or On-Premises). +

By default, this plugin allows you to deploy using five different deployment strategies:

* CloudHub deployment. +
Automate the deployment of your Mule Application to CloudHub.
* Runtime Fabric deployment. +
Deploy your Mule Application to Runtime Fabric.
* Runtime Manager REST API deployment. +
Deploy your Mule Application to your server, or server clusters using the Runtime Manager REST API.
* Mule Agent deployment. +
Deploy your Mule Application using the Mule Agent. +
This deployment strategy only works if all your Mule instances live under the same address space.
* Standalone runtime deployment. +
Deploy to a Mule instance running on your machine.

When deploying an application using the Mule Maven plugin you need to specify a valid deployment configuration in your `pom.xml` file. +
You can set up a deployment configuration using their dedicated deployment references.

== Deploy a Mule Application to CloudHub

=== Prerequisites

* The host and port number of your HTTP Listener flow sources are properly configured. +
+
If you are using the HTTP Listener as sources for your flow, you need to set its host to *0.0.0.0* and its port to *${http.port}*.
+
CloudHub then dynamically allocates a port at deployment time.
+
* All your external classes and resources are properly declared in the `mule-artifact.json` file of your Mule application.
+
Due to Mule 4.x classloading isolation mechanism, all external classes and resources must be explicitly declared in the "exportedPackages" and "exportedResources" fields on the `mule-artifact.json` file before packaging and deploying the app.
+
See xref:how-to-export-resources.adoc[Export Resources] to learn more about working with external resources in your Mule application.

=== Deploying to CloudHub

. Make sure you added the Mule Maven plugin to your `pom.xml` file.
. Inside the `plugin` element, add a configuration for your CloudHub deployment, replacing the placeholder values with your CloudHub information:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<plugin>
include::example$mmp-concept-config.xml[]
  <configuration>
    <cloudHubDeployment>
      <uri>https://anypoint.mulesoft.com</uri>
      <muleVersion>${app.runtime}</muleVersion>
      <username>${username}</username>
      <password>${password}</password>
      <applicationName>${cloudhub.application.name}</applicationName>
      <environment>${environment}</environment>
      <properties>
        <key>value</key>
      </properties>
    </cloudHubDeployment>
  </configuration>
</plugin>
----
+
. From the command line in your project's folder, package the app and execute the deploy goal:
+
[source,console,linenums]
----
mvn clean package deploy -DmuleDeploy
----

=== Redeploying to CloudHub

To redeploy the app, run the same command as you did to deploy. +
CloudHub rewrites the app you had deployed.

=== Undeploying from CloudHub

To undeploy an app, run the following command:

[source,console,linenums]
----
mvn mule:undeploy
----

The undeploy command also deletes the app in Mule Maven plugin 3.3.0 and later versions.

== Deploy a Mule Application to Runtime Fabric

=== Prerequisites

* Before deploying an application to Runtime Fabric, check the number of resources required. See xref:runtime-fabric::deploy-resource-allocation.adoc[Resource Allocation on Anypoint Runtime Fabric] for more information.
* The application must be published in Exchange. +
** To do this from Studio, see xref:studio::export-to-exchange-task.adoc[Publishing a Project to Exchange]. +
** To do this using Maven, see xref:exchange::to-publish-assets-maven.adoc[Publish and Deploy Exchange Assets Using Maven].

[NOTE]
Studio allows you to select only two project types when uploading an application to Exchange: `example` and `template`. To specify a different project type, publish your application using Maven.

. From the command line in your project's folder, package the domain and execute the deploy goal:
+
[source,console,linenums]
----
mvn clean package deploy -DmuleDeploy
----

== Encrypt Credentials

Encrypted credentials are available in all platform deployments: CloudHub, Runtime Fabric, and Runtime Manager.
To use encrypted credentials when deploying, you need to set up your Maven master encrypted password and your `settings-security.xml` file.

. Create a master password for your Maven configuration.
+
----
mvn --encrypt-master-password <yourMasterPassword>
----
+
Maven returns your master password encrypted:
+
----
{l9vZ2uM5SdgHy+H12z4pX7LEOZn3Kbnqmt3kIquLjnQ=}
----
+
. Create a `settings-security.xml` file in your ~/.m2 repository and add your encrypted master password.
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<settingsSecurity>
  <master>{l9vZ2uM5SdgHy+H12z4pX7LEOZn3Kbnqmt3kIquLjnQ=}</master>
</settingsSecurity>
----
+
. Encrypt your Anypoint platform password:
+
----
mvn --encrypt-password <yourAnypointPlatformPassword>
----
+
Maven returns your Anypoint platform password encrypted:
+
----
{HTWFGH5BG9QmvJ1B=}
----
. Add your encrypted Anypoint Platform password to your `settings.xml` file in the <server> section:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<settings>
 ...
  <servers>
   ...
    <server>
      <id>my.anypoint.credentials</id>
      <username>my.anypoint.username</username>
      <password>{HTWFGH5BG9QmvJ1B=}</password>
    </server>
   ...
  </servers>
 ...
</settings>
----
. In your configuration deployment, reference the credentials injecting the server id configured in your `settings.xml` file.
Below is an example of a CloudHub Deployment using encrypted credentials:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<plugin>
include::example$mmp-concept-config.xml[]
  <configuration>
      <cloudHubDeployment>
          <uri>https://anypoint.mulesoft.com</uri>
          <muleVersion>${app.runtime}</muleVersion>
          <server>my.anypoint.credentials</server>
          <applicationName>${cloudhub.application.name}</applicationName>
          <environment>${environment}</environment>
          <properties>
              <key>value</key>
          </properties>
      </cloudHubDeployment>
  </configuration>
</plugin>
----

NOTE: Make sure that the username and password are not set in the deployment configuration, or they will overwrite the defined server ID.

== Skip Plugin Execution

You can skip the plugin execution by setting the `skip` parameter to true inside your deployment configuration:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<plugin>
include::example$mmp-concept-config.xml[]
  <configuration>
    <standaloneDeployment>
      <muleHome>${mule.home.test}</muleHome>
      <skip>true</skip>
    </standaloneDeployment>
  </configuration>
</plugin>
----

== Skip Deployment Verification

You can skip the status verification of your deployed app by setting the `skipDeploymentVerification` parameter to true inside of any of the platform deployments (Cloudhub, Runtime Manager, and Runtime Fabric):

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<plugin>
include::example$mmp-concept-config.xml[]
  <configuration>
    <runtimeFabricDeployment>
      ...
      <skipDeploymentVerification>true</skipDeploymentVerification>
      ...
    </runtimeFabricDeployment>
  </configuration>
</plugin>
----

If the `skipDeploymentVerification` parameter is not present, the default value is false. +
This feature is available in plugin version 3.2.5 and later.

== Anypoint Runtime Manager On-Premises TLS Errors

When trying to connect to an instance of Runtime Manager that's on an  xref:1.5@private-cloud::index.adoc[Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition] installation, the plugin validates certificates for that server. If you haven't installed the server certificates in your truststore, an SSL error occurs. To avoid this problem, you can run the plugin in an insecure mode, which skips the security validations. You can use the *armInsecure* tag or the *arm.insecure* system property.

[WARNING]
Enabling an insecure connection is a dangerous practice. Don't use this unless you know what you are doing and your On-Premises installation is isolated in a local network.

See the configuration example below:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<plugin>
include::example$mmp-concept-config.xml[]
  <configuration>
    <armDeployment>
        <target>${target}</target>
        <targetType>${target.type}</targetType>
        <username>${username}</username>
        <password>${password}</password>
        <environment>${environment}</environment>
        <armInsecure>true</armInsecure>
    </armDeployment>
  </configuration>
</plugin>
----
