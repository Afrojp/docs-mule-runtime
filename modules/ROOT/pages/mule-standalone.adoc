If you want to host Mule runtime engine (Mule) in your own environment, first xref:hardware-and-software-requirements.adoc[verify that you meet all hardware and software requirements], and then xref:runtime-installation-task.adoc[download and install Mule].

You don't need to install Mule in the following scenarios:

* When you use Anypoint Studio (which contains Mule) for development and testing
* When you deploy applications to CloudHub or Anypoint Runtime Fabric.

If you want to manage your on-premises Mule instance using Runtime Manager, xref:runtime-manager::servers-create.adoc[register it using the Runtime Manager agent].
