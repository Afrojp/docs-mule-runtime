If you want to host Mule runtime engine in your own environment, xref:hardware-and-software-requirements.adoc[verify that you meet hardware and software requirements], then xref:runtime-installation-task.adoc[download and install Mule].

You don't need to install Mule in the following scenarios:

* When you use Studio for development and testing, because Studio contains Mule embedded.
* When you deploy applications to CloudHub or Runtime Fabric.

If you want to manage your on-premises Mule instance using Runtime Manager, xref:runtime-manager::servers-create.adoc[register it using the Runtime Manager agent]
