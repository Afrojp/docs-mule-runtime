= Default Event Tracking
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]

Event tracking requires some processing and network overhead to aggregate and store the events that Mule runtime engine generates. By default, tracking is disabled for connectors or message processors that support it.

Default event tracking can be configured in two ways:

* At the flow level.
* At the message processor (connector or component) level, which takes precedence over the flow level setting.

[events_tracking_flow_level]
== Event Tracking at The Flow Level

Use this option to enable default event tracking for all elements in a flow that support event tracking.
You can disable tracking for specific processors or connectors to override the flow level setting.

Steps to enable:

. Select your flow component to open the properties view.
. Enable default business events using any of the following options:
+
* In the UI, select *Enable default events tracking*.
+

+
* In the XML, add attribute `tracking:enable-default-events="true"` to the `flow` element, for example:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<flow name="testFlow" tracking:enable-default-events="true">
----

[event_tracking_processor_level]
== Enabling Event Tracking at The Message Processor Level

You can enable event tracking on individual connectors and components that support event tracking. Not all processors support default event tracking. If the *Enable default events tracking* option is not present in a message processor or connector, default tracking is not supported.

Steps to enable:

. Open the Connector or component properties view.
. Enable default business events using any of the following options:
+
* In the UI, select *Enable default events tracking* inside the business events panel.
+
image::mruntime-business-event-component.png[default-event-tracking-component]
+
* In the XML, add attribute `tracking:enable-default-events="true"` inside your component element, for example:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<flow name="flow">
  ...
    <choice doc:name="Choice" tracking:enable-default-events="true"/>
  ...
</flow>

[events_transaction_id]
== Customizing the Transaction ID

Define a transaction ID so that meaningful information, such as an order number, is displayed for a transaction when you analyze tracked events at runtime. If you do not customize the transaction ID, Mule assigns a numeric transaction ID by default.

The transaction ID supports DataWeave expressions. Each custom ID must be unique for each transaction in your application. Follow these steps to set a transaction ID:

* In the UI:
+
. Drag the *Set Transaction Id* component to your flow.
. Define a transaction ID.
+

* In the XML, add a child element to the `flow` element, for example:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<flow name="flow">
...
  <tracking:transaction id="#[payload.orderId]" />
...
</flow>
----
