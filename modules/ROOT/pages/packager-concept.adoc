Mule uses a packager tool to package your Mule application into a deployable JAR file. +
You can operate this packager using the Mule Maven Plugin.

The package contains the application and all its dependencies whether those be JAR files required by the application or by its plugins.

Every Mule application has two descriptors. These descriptors tell the packager tool how to handle your Mule application's dependencies.

* A `mule-artifact.json` file. +
This file describes how your application is composed. +

* A `pom.xml` file. +
This file describes all the dependencies required by the package to work properly.
