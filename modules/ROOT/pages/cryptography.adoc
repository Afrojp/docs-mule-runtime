This module provides cryptography capabilities to a Mule application. Its main features include:

* Symmetric encryption and decryption of messages.
* Asymmetric encryption and decryption of messages.
* Message signing and signature validation of signed messages.

This module supports three different strategies to encrypt and sign your messages:

* xref:cryptography-pgp.adoc[PGP]: Signature/encryption using PGP.
* xref:cryptography-xml.adoc[XML]: For signing or encrypting XML documents or elements.
* xref:cryptography-jce.adoc[JCE]: For using a wider range of cryptography capabilities as provided by the Java Cryptography Extension.

Additionally, this module offers two general operations to calculate and validate stream checksums. +
See xref:cryptography-reference.adoc[General Operations] for more information.
