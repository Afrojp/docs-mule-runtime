:keywords: request reply, asynchronous

The Request-Reply Scope enables you to embed a pocket of asynchronous processing within a flow. This functionality enables you to receive a response from an asynchronous flow without hardcoding the destination of the response. +
For example, you can use request-reply to convert a one-way VM or JMS connector flow to a request-response flow without having to change it's configuration. The request-reply converts part of a synchronous process into an asynchronous one.

== Basic Anatomy

Request-reply consists of two parts:

* The *request* section. +
It wraps an outbound connector that submits an asynchronous request to another flow or an external resource.
* The *reply* section. +
It wraps an inbound connector that receives an asynchronous response from another flow or an external resource

When the message reaches the processor inside the request section of the Request-Reply scope, Mule runtime engine (Mule) sends an asynchronous request to the outbound endpoint's path, triggering the process of the remote resource. +
After that processing is complete, Mule sends the response back to the path defined in the processor's inbound endpoint in the reply section of the scope.

Consider the following application:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<flow name="sampleFlow">

  <http:listener config-ref="HTTP_Listener_Configuration" path="/start"/>

  <request-reply doc:name="Request-Reply">
   <vm:outbound-endpoint exchange-pattern="one-way" path="request"/> //<1>
   <vm:inbound-endpoint exchange-pattern="one-way" path="reply" /> //<3>
  </request-reply>

</flow>

<flow name="requestFlow">
  <vm:inbound-endpoint exchange-pattern="one-way" path="request"/> //<2>
  <logger message="#[payload]" level="INFO"/>
</flow>
----
<1> After receiving an HTTP request, the VM outbound-endpoint processor sends the message to the `/request` path.
<1> The VM inbound-endpoint processor with the `/request` path configured receives the message, triggering the requestFlow processing.
<1> After `requestFlow` finishes processing, Mule automatically sends the message back to VM inbound-endpoint in the reply section of the Request-Reply scope.

To achieve this behavior, Mule implicitly sets a `MULE_REPLYTO` message property to point to the processor in the reply section of the scope. +
In this case, the VM inbound-endpoint processor in requestFlow's source receives the message with the `MULE_REPLYTO_REQUESTOR` property set to `"reply"`, so Mule sends the resulting message (or messages) back to the requester.

== Using VM Connectors in the Requested Flow

Consider a scenario where you have a Request-Reply scope and the requested flow has a VM outbound endpoint at the end pointing to a different flow.
In this case, the VM processor inside the reply scope still receives the message (or messages) from the triggered flow.

To disable this behavior, you must set the `MULE_REPLYTO_STOP` variable to `true`:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<flow name="sampleFlow">
  <http:listener config-ref="HTTP_Listener_Configuration" path="/start"/>
  <request-reply doc:name="Request-Reply">
   <vm:outbound-endpoint exchange-pattern="one-way" path="slice"/>
   <vm:inbound-endpoint exchange-pattern="one-way" path="complete" />
  </request-reply>
</flow>

<flow name="slicerFlow">
  <vm:inbound-endpoint exchange-pattern="one-way" path="slice" />
  <!-- Set Variable MULE_REPLYTO_STOP = true -->
  <set-variable variableName="MULE_REPLYTO_STOP" value="true" /> //<1>
  <collection-splitter />
  <vm:outbound-endpoint exchange-pattern="one-way" path="enhance" />
</flow>

<flow name="enhancerFlow">
  <vm:inbound-endpoint exchange-pattern="one-way" path="enhance" />
  <collection-aggregator failOnTimeout="true" />
  <vm:outbound-endpoint exchange-pattern="one-way" path="complete" />
</flow>
----

<1> Setting `MULE_REPLYTO_STOP` to `true`, prevents Mule from configuring the `MULE_REPLYTO_REQUESTOR` property in the received message.

== Limitations

You can't use transactions in VM and JMS connectors inside a request-reply scope. Transactions are not compatible with the way the request-reply scope works.

The request-reply scope does not send a request until a transaction is committed, and a transaction in turn is not committed until the entire flow executes, including the execution of the request-reply scope. This leads to a situation where both processes block each other. +
Mule cannot execute the complete flow because it's still waiting for the reply on the request-reply scope, but this reply never arrives because the request is not sent until the transaction is committed.
