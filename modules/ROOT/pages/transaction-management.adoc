Transactions are operations in a Mule app for which the result cannot remain indeterminate. When a series of steps in a flow must succeed or fail as one unit, Mule uses a transaction to demarcate that unit.

For example, you might use a transaction to encapsulate several steps in a flow that result in committing information to a database. In this type of scenario, the commit (or transaction) is either entirely complete and succeeds, or is incomplete and fails. Even if partially complete, the commit fails. When a transaction fails, Mule rolls back the operations within the transaction so that no part results in partial completion.

MuleSoft recommends implementing a xref:reliability-patterns.adoc[Reliability Pattern] to design your application so it is capable of reliable messaging, even if the application receives messages from a non-transactional connector.

== Transaction Types

Mule supports Single Resource (Local, the default) and Extended Architecture (`XA`) transaction types (`transactionType`). The only components that can define the transaction type are message sources (For example, `jms:listener` and `vm:listener`) and the Try scope.

The following table describes the characteristics of each transaction type and the requisites for an operation to join the transaction:

[%header,cols="20a,35a,45a"]
|===
| Transaction Type | Characteristics | Requisites to Join the Transaction
| Single Resource (local)
|
* Performs better than XA transactions.
|
* The operation must support transactions.
* All operations inside the transaction must belong to the same Connector. (For example `jms:listener`, `jms:consume` and `jms:publish`).
* All operations must use the same Global Configuration (`config-ref`).
| XA
|
* Involves using a two-phase commit protocol (2PC).
* Slower but more reliable than Single Resource transactions.
|
* The operation must support transactions.

|===

== Transactional Actions

A Transactional Action (`transactionalAction`) defines the type of action that operations take regarding transactions. The following table describes all available transactional actions:

[%header,cols="20a,40a,40a"]
|===
| Action | Behavior | Available in

| `ALWAYS_BEGIN`
| Always start a new transaction when receiving a message. An error is raised if a transaction already exists.
|
* Listeners that support transactions
* Try scope

| `ALWAYS_JOIN`
| Always expect a transaction to be in progress when a message is received. If there is no transaction, an error is raised.
|
* Operations that support transactions

| `BEGIN_OR_JOIN`
| If a transaction is already in progress when a message is received, join the transaction if possible. Otherwise, start a new transaction.
|
* Try scope

| `JOIN_IF_POSSIBLE`
| Join the current transaction if one is available. Otherwise, no transaction is created.
|
* Operations that support transactions

| `INDIFFERENT`
| Do not treat actions as a transaction.
|
* Try scope

| `NONE`
| Do not initiate a transaction.
|
* Listeners that support transactions

| `NOT_SUPPORTED`
| Execute outside any existent transaction.
|
* Operations that support transactions
|===

== Configuring a Transaction in the Message Source

You can start a transaction from a message source. In this case, the entire flow becomes a transaction. This is useful when working with messaging connectors to prevent the consumption of the message if a problem occurs when processing it, allowing you to retry later (because of the rollback).

To initiate a transaction from a message source, configure its Transaction type and Transactional action:

* In Anypoint Studio
+
Open the Listener's *Advanced* tab, and set the *Transaction type* and the *Transactional action* values:
+
image::transaction-config-studio-vm.png[transaction-config-studio-vm]

* In the Configuration XML
+
Add the `transactionalAction` element and the `transactionType` element (if necessary), and set their values.
+
The XML example below illustrates a `vm:listener` message source configured to initiate a Single Resource (Local) transaction:

== Configuring a Transaction in a Try Scope

A Mule flow can also begin with a non-transactional connector (such as HTTP) that requires a transaction within the flow. For example, a Mule flow might accept information from an external Web service, then transform the data before charging a credit card and saving invoice information to a database. In such a situation, you use the Try scope to set up a transaction by wrapping the credit card charge and database commit operations within a transaction to ensure either complete success or complete failure and rollback.

You can configure a transaction in a Try scope component by setting a Transaction type and Transactional action:

* In Anypoint Studio
+
Open the Try scope's *General* tab, and set the *Transaction type* and the *Transactional action* values:
+
image::transaction-config-studio.png[transaction-config-studio]

* In the Configuration XML
+
Add the `transactionalAction` element and the `transactionType` element (if necessary), and set their values.
+
Below is an XML example where the Try scope demarcates a transaction that includes a Database operation (`db:insert`) and a VM operation (`vm:publish`). Either both will be applied if the entire process succeeds, or none will be applied if an error is raised within the Try scope:

== How Transactions Affect Scopes and Routers

When running in a transactional scope, the entire process must run in the same thread. This can change the way a scope executes, or how a transaction is handled. Below is detailed the behavior of the scopes and routers you must consider when running in a transactional scope:

=== Scopes

* xref:async-scope-reference.adoc[Async]: When running within a transaction, the Async scope will still run in another thread (remaining asynchronous). However, this means that the entire execution of the processors within this scope is out of the transactional scope. Therefore, any error produced inside an Async scope does not result in a rollback.
* xref:until-successful-scope.adoc[Until Successful]: When running within a transaction, the Until Successful scope blocks the thread. This means that the thread used by this execution cannot be used to process any other request while the Until Successful scope is performing the delay between retries.
* xref:parallel-foreach-scope.adoc[Parallel Foreach]: When running within a transaction, the Parallel Foreach scope does not execute in parallel. This means it executes as the Foreach scope: the second element of the collection is processed after the first one has finished. This does not affect the way this scope handles errors.
* xref:batch-processing-concept.adoc[Batch Processing]: Since Batch Processing is designed to work on parallel as the Async scope, and every record is treated transactionally (with internal Batch transactions), the batch execution is not part of the transaction.

=== Routers

* xref:scatter-gather-concept.adoc[Scatter Gather]: When running within a transaction, Scatter Gather does not execute in parallel. This means that the second route is executed after the first one is processed, the third after the second one, etc. This does not affect the way this component handles errors.
* xref:flowref-about.adoc[Flow Reference]: If the flow (or subflow) being executed is running within a transaction, the execution of the flow (or subflow) referenced by the `flow-ref` continues with the same transaction. If the referenced flow has a message source that begins a transaction (For example a `jms:listener` source with `transactionalAction="ALWAYS_BEGIN"`), the `transactionalAction` is ignored. The `flow-ref` component executes the referenced flow components except for its message source.

Any other router or scope (for example, Foreach) continues with the transaction and its behavior is not modified.

== Error Handling

When working with transactions, we need to know how to handle errors. This includes to continue with the transaction even if an specific error occurs, or to handle correctly the rollback. 

As mentioned in the xref:on-error-scope-concept.adoc[On-Error Scope], there are two types of Error Handlers, which relate differently with Transactions:

* On Error Propagate: If the `on-error-propagate` is in the Error Handler corresponding to the component that began the Transaction, then it rolls it backs **before executing the processors of the On Error Propagate Scope**. Thus, those processors inside the error handler do not run within the transaction. If the `on-error-propagate` is inside an inner element that did not start the Transaction, then it is not rolled back and the inner processors of such `on-error-propagate` remain running within the Transaction. Remember that running within a Transaction affect different scopes and routers. 
* On Error Continue: the error is treated as managed and the Transaction remains active (and is able to commit). The inner processors of the On Error Continue run within the Transaction.

For example:

.
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<flow name="someFlowWithTx">
	<jms:listener config-ref="JMS_Config" destination="test.in" transactionalAction="ALWAYS_BEGIN"/>
	<!-- Processors -->
	<try>
		<raise-error type="APP:SOME"/>
		<error-handler>
			<on-error-propagate>
				<logger message="Fails"/>
			</on-error-propagate>
		</error-handler>
	</try>
	<error-handler>
		<on-error-continue>
			<logger message="continue with tx"/>
		</on-error-continue>
	</error-handler>
</flow>
----

In the example, the message source (`jms:listener`) starts a Transaction, which is continued by the `try` Scope (`transactionalAction` is set to default, `INDIFFERENT`). When the error is raised, it is handled by the `error-handler` of the `try` Scope first. Even when the error is handled by an `on-error-propagate`, the Transaction is not rolled back, since it was not the `try` Scope the one that started it, so only the error handler of the flow can rollback the Transaction which was began at flow level. Then, the `logger` inside the `on-error-propagate` will continue running within the Transaction. The error is then propagated to the flow's `error-handler`, which handles it with an `on-error-continue`. The `logger` inside such `on-error-continue` runs within the transaction. Finally, the transaction is commited. 

If the `flow` had an `on-error-propagate` instead of `on-error-continue`, then the transactional would have been rolled back, and the logger within that `on-error-propagate` will not run within the Transaction. 

This example has the same explanation if, instead of having a `try` Scope, we work with a Flow Reference to another flow: 

.
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<flow name="someFlowWithTx">
	<jms:listener config-ref="JMS_Config" destination="test.in" transactionalAction="ALWAYS_BEGIN"/>
	<!-- Processors -->
	<flow-ref name="someFlowContinuesTx"/>
	<error-handler>
		<on-error-continue>
			<logger message="continue with tx"/>
		</on-error-continue>
	</error-handler>
</flow>

<flow name="someFlowContinuesTx">
	<raise-error type="APP:SOME"/>
	<error-handler>
		<on-error-propagate>
			<logger message="Fails"/>
		</on-error-propagate>
	</error-handler>
</flow>
----

Since the `someFlowContinuesTx` Flow is not the one that started the transaction, then its Error Handler will not roll it back. 

Another example to understand the difference in the behaviour of the two types of Error Handlers will be the next one:

.
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<flow name="someFlow">
	<jms:listener config-ref="JMS_Config" destination="test.in" transactionalAction="ALWAYS_BEGIN"/>
	<raise-error type="APP:SOME"/>
	<error-handler>
		<on-error-continue>
			<try transactionalAction="ALWAYS_BEGIN">
				<logger message="hello"/>
			</try>
		</on-error-continue>
	</error-handler>
</flow>

<flow name="someFlow2">
	<jms:listener config-ref="JMS_Config" destination="test.in" transactionalAction="ALWAYS_BEGIN"/>
	<raise-error type="APP:SOME"/>
	<error-handler>
		<on-error-propagate>
			<try transactionalAction="ALWAYS_BEGIN">
				<logger message="hello"/>
			</try>
		</on-error-propagate>
	</error-handler>
</flow>
----

Since the `on-error-continue` continues with the Transaction, that configuration is not a valid one. Therefore, this results in an error. In the second flow, as the Transaction has already been rolled back by the moment the inner processors of the `on-error-propagate` are executed, the configuration is correct.
