Transactions are operations in a Mule app for which the result cannot remain indeterminate. When a series of steps in a flow must succeed or fail as one unit, Mule uses a transaction to demarcate that unit.

For example, you might use a transaction to encapsulate several steps in a flow that result in committing information to a database. In this type of scenario, the commit (or transaction) is either entirely complete and succeeds, or is incomplete and fails. Even if partially complete, the commit fails. When a transaction fails, Mule rolls back the operations within the transaction so that no part results in partial completion.

== Configuring a Transaction in the Message Source

You can start a transaction from a message source. In this case, the entire flow becomes a transaction. This is useful when working with messaging connectors to prevent the consumption of the message if a problem occurs when processing it, allowing you to retry later (because of the rollback).

You can configure a transaction in a message source from its *Advanced* tab in Studio:

The XML example below illustrates a `vm:listener` message source configured to initiate a transaction:

== Configuring a Transaction in a Try Scope

A Mule flow can also begin with a non-transactional connector (such as HTTP) that requires a transaction within the flow. For example, a Mule flow might accept information from an external Web service, then transform the data before charging a credit card and saving invoice information to a database. In such a situation, you use the Try scope to set up a transaction by wrapping the credit card charge and database commit operations within a transaction to ensure either complete success or complete failure and rollback.

You can initiate a transaction from a Try scope component either by dragging it from the Mule Palette in Studio to your flow, or including the `try` element in your configuration XML.

== Transactional Actions
The Try scope provides a way to configure a transaction from its *General* tab in Studio:

A Transactional Action (`transactionalAction`)
image::transaction-config-studio.png[transaction-config-studio]

* ALWAYS_BEGIN: Always start a new transaction when receiving a message. An exception will be thrown if a transaction already exists. Listeners that support transactions have this option.
Below is an XML example where the Try scope demarcates a transaction that includes a Database operation (`db:insert`) and a VM operation (`vm:publish`). Either both will be applied if the entire process succeeds, or none will be applied if an error is raised within the Try scope:

* ALWAYS_JOIN: Always expect a transaction to be in progress when a message is received. If there is no transaction, an exception is thrown. Operations that support transactions have this option.

* BEGIN_OR_JOIN: If a transaction is already in progress when a message is received, join the transaction if possible. Otherwise, start a new transaction. Scopes that support transactions provide this setting.
== Transaction Types

* JOIN_IF_POSSIBLE: Join the current transaction if one is available. Otherwise, no transaction is created. Operations that support transactions provide this setting.
Mule supports Single Resource (Local, the default) and Extended Architecture (`XA`) transaction types (`transactionType`). The only components that can define the transaction type are message sources (For example, `jms:listener` and `vm:listener`) and the Try scope.

The following table describes characteristics of each transaction type and the requisites for an operation to join the transaction:

[%header,cols="20a,35a,45a"]
|===
| Transaction Type | Characteristics | Requisites to Join the transaction
| Single Resource (local)
|
* Performs better than XA transactions.
|
* The operation must support transactions.
* All operations inside the transaction must belong to the same Connector. (For example `jms:listener`, `jms:consume` and `jms:publish`).
* All operations must use the same Global Configuration (`config-ref`).
| XA
|
* Involves using a two-phase commit protocol (2PC).
* Slower but more reliable than Single Resource transactions.
|
* The operation must support transactions.

|===

* INDIFFERENT: Do not treat actions as a transaction. Scopes that support transactions provide this setting.

* NONE: Never participate in a transaction. Listeners that support transactions provide this setting.

* NOT_SUPPORTED: Execute outside any existent transaction. Operations that support transactions provide this setting. Scopes that support transactions provide this setting.


Mule supports Single Resource (Local, the default) and Extended Architecture (`XA`) transaction types (`transactionType`). The following table describes characteristics of each type.

* Single Resource Transactions (Local)

* XA Transactions
 ** Receives or sends messages to more than one resource.
 ** Involves using a two-phase commit algorithm.

== Scopes and Routers' behaviour with Transactions

When running in a transactional scope, the entire process must run in the same Thread. This may change the way a Scope executes, or the transaction is handled. These are the Scopes you must consider when running in a transactional scope: 

* xref:async-scope-reference.adoc[Async Scope]: When running within a transaction, the async scope will still run in another thread (remaining asynchronous). However, this means that the entire execution of the processors within this scope are out of the transactional scope. Therefore, any error produced inside an Async Scope does not result in a rollback.
* xref:scatter-gather-reference.adoc[Scatter Gather]: When running within a transaction, Scatter Gather does not execute in parallel. This means that the second route will execute after the first one is processed, the third after the second one, etc. This does not affect the way this component handles errors.
* xref:until-successful-scope.adoc[Until Sucessful]: When running within a transaction, the Until Successful Scope is blocking. This means that the thread used by this execution cannot be used to process any other request while the Until Successful is performing the delay between retries.
* xref:parallel-foreach-scope.adoc[Parallel Foreach]: When running within a transaction, Parallel Foreach Scope does not execute in parallel. This means it will execute as the Foreach Scope: the second element of the collection will be processed after the first one has finished. This does not affect the way this scope handles errors. 
* xref:batch-processing-concept.adoc[Batch]: Since batch is designed to work on parallel as Async Scope, and every record is treated transactionally (with internal Batch Transactions), the batch execution will not be part of the transaction. 
* xref:flowref-about.adoc[Flow Ref]: If the flow (or subflow) being executed is running within a transaction, the execution of the flow (or subflow) referenced by the `flow-ref` will continue with the same transaction. If the flow referenced has a Message Source, which begins a transaction (e.g. a JMS `jms:listener` source with `transactionalAction="ALWAYS_BEGIN"`), such `transactionalAction` is ignore as the `flow-ref` component executes the referenced flow components skipping the message source. 
* Any other router or scope (e.g. Foreach) will continue with transaction and its behaviour will not be modified.
