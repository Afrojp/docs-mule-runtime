If you want to consume a SOAP API that does not have its own Anypoint Connector, you can use the Web Service Consumer connector.

Using the information contained in the API's WSDL, the connector provides the connection configuration you need for consuming a service from within your Mule application:

. First, identify the location of the Web service's WSDL file.

. Then at design time, the connector helps you to configure the parameters by using the metadata retrieved from the WSDL â€“ host, port, address.
