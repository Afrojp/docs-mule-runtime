If you want to consume an API that does not already have its own Anypoint Connector, use the *Web Service Consumer* connector to consume any SOAP API from within your Mule application.

Using the information contained in the API's WSDL, this connector enables you to configure a few details to establish the connection you need for consuming a service from within your Mule application. +
First, identify the location of the Web service's WSDL file, then ask the Web Service Consumer to configure itself from the WSDL â€“ host, port, address.

Learn more about the xref:connectors::web-service/web-service-consumer.adoc[Web Service Consumer] connector.
