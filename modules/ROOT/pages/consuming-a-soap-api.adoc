If you want to consume an API that does not have its own Anypoint Connector, you can use the Web Service Consumer connector.

Using the information contained in the API's WSDL, this connector enables you to configure a few details to establish the connection you need for consuming a service from within your Mule application:

. Identify the location of the Web service's WSDL file.

. Request the Web Service Consumer to configure itself from the WSDL â€“ host, port, address.

Learn more about the xref:connectors::web-service/web-service-consumer.adoc[Web Service Consumer] connector.
