Anypoint Connectors are extensions of Mule that let you work with external systems such as Salesforce, 
ServiceNow, Workday, Twitter, and more to send and receive information from these systems to create something new.

Anypoint Connectors let you connect Mule applications to APIs and resources. You can use connectors within your 
Mule applications to send and receive data over a protocol, or to and from an API.

You can create applications in Anypoint Studio by installing a connector from Anypoint Exchange, 
and then dragging the connector to the Studio canvas. 

When you add a connector to the start of a flow, it's known as a message processor
because it starts the Mule flow by receiving information from the connector's resource. For example, 
when a Salesforce user updates a sales opportunity, the connector application can receive 
the information and direct it to a database or to another connector for processing. 

Similarly, you can use the HTTP connector as the message processor so that users can send information to your 
Studio application using a web browser, Postman, or the curl command.
