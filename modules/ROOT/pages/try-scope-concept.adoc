= Try Scope

The Try scope allows you to handle errors that may occur when attempting to execute any of the components inside the Try scope. It also supports transactions. A Try scope wraps one or more event processors, then catches and handles any exceptions that might be thrown by any of these enclosed event processors. The behavior is as if you extracted those enclosed event components into a separate flow with its own error handling strategy, but inline, without having to actually define a new flow.

== Error Handling with the Try Scope

The Try scope has its own error handling strategy that you configure in the same way you configure error handling for a flow. The Try scope supports error handling for the components inside the scope instead of the entire flow, so that you do not have to extract them into a separate flow.

//image::component-try-config.png[Try Component Configuration]

Like all error handling, the Try scope can also distinguish between various error type conditions and apply different behaviors to each error type condition.

Just like any error that is raised inside a flow, if an error is raised by a component inside a Try scope, then the Try scope's error handler is executed, and the error is routed to the matching handler. At this point, the error is available for inspection, so the handlers can execute and act accordingly:

* An On Error Continue executes and sends the result of the execution to its container Try scope, which uses that result to complete the execution successfully. Any transactions at this point are also committed.
* An On Error Propagate rolls back any transactions, then executes and uses that result to re-throw the existing error, meaning that its container Try Scope's execution fails.

If the Try scope has several components, then once a component raises an exception, subsequent components in the Try scope are skipped, regardless of the type of error handler that catches the exception. In the case of On Error Propagate, the error is propagated to the flow's error handler, as if the Try scope did not exist. In the case of On Error Continue, processing continues outside the Try scope at the next downstream flow component, as if the Try scope never threw an exception.

In the example above, any database connection errors (`DB:CONNECTIVITY`) are propagated because of the On Error Propagate (`on-error-propagate`) setting. Propagation of this error causes the Try process to fail and the flowâ€™s error handler to execute. Other errors are handled through On Error Continue (`on-error-continue`), so the Try is treated as successful when they occur, meaning that the next processor, an HTTP request, continues its execution.

Within your flow, you can group a set of event processors that might throw an error inside a Try Scope. The Try Scope allows you to enclose various event processors in your flow and assign it an Error Handler scope in case that operation fails. +

You can also configure the operation inside the Try Scope to be processed as a transaction.

== Handling Transactions

You configure a Try scope so that it treats its child operations as an indivisible transaction. A transaction is a series of actions that should never be partially executed. Every operation within the scope of a transaction is executed in the same thread, and errors must lead to either a rollback or a commit.

image::error-handling-try-scope-config.png[Try Scope Configuration]

The Try scope treats child operations as a transaction when the Transactional Action (`transactionalAction`) is set to `ALWAYS_BEGIN` or `BEGIN_OR_JOIN`. It can be configured in the following ways:

* Ignore (`INDIFFERENT`):
+
Default. If there is an active transaction, continues with it (the scope _joins_ the transaction). If not, no transaction is created.

* Always Begin (`ALWAYS_BEGIN`)
+
A new transaction is started every time the scope is executed.

* Begin or Join (`BEGIN_OR_JOIN`)
+
Only relevant in cases where execution order may vary (for example, due to asynchronous actions occurring outside the flow). If the current processing of the flow has already started a transaction, join it. Otherwise, initiate a new one.


=== Analyzing Different Transactional Actions in Try Scope

The following example shows a `jms:listener` configured to initiate a transaction at flow level, a `try` scope that tries to initiate or join the transaction (depending on its configuration), and a `jms:publish` operation configured to run outside of the transaction.

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<flow name="someFlow">
	<jms:listener config-ref="JMS_Config" destination="test.in" transactionalAction="ALWAYS_BEGIN"/>
	<!-- Processors -->
	<try transactionalAction="${action}">
		<!-- Processors -->
		<!-- Join if possible is the default value for jms:publish operation -->
		<jms:publish config-ref="JMS_Config" destination="test.out" transactionalAction="NOT_SUPPORTED"/>
		<raise-error type="APP:SOME"/>
		<!-- More Processors -->
	</try>
	<!-- Processors -->
</flow>
----

If the processors within the `try` Scope do not produce any error, the scope finishes the execution and commits the transaction, independently of the configured `transactionalAction` value.

The transaction and the messages are handled differently when a `<raise-error/>` processor is added, depending on the `transactionalAction` of the `try` scope:

* Ignore (`INDIFFERENT`): In this case, the transaction is continued while executing the processors inside the Try scope. When the error is raised, it is propagated to the source (which does not handle it with an `<on-error-continue>`). The transaction is rolled back, and the message will be available again in the JMS queue. However, the `jms:publish` operation was completed and the message has been sent since the rollback of the transaction does not affect the publish operation, which was outside of the transaction scope (the `transactionAction` is set to its default, `NOT_SUPPORTED`).
** If the `transactionalAction` of the `jms:publish` operation is set to `JOIN_IF_POSSIBLE`, then the operation is rolled back.
* Always Begin (`ALWAYS_BEGIN`): This raises an error because an active transaction already exists.
* Begin or Join (`BEGIN_OR_JOIN`): In this case, a transaction was already initiated so the scope joins the active transaction. The result is the same as in `INDIFFERENT`.

==== Error Handler at Flow Level

In the following example, an error handler is added at flow level:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<flow name="someFlow">
	<jms:listener config-ref="JMS_Config" destination="test.in" transactionalAction="ALWAYS_BEGIN"/>
	<!-- Processors -->
	<try transactionalAction="${action}">
		<!-- Processors -->
		<!-- Join if possible is the default value for jms:publish operation -->
		<jms:publish config-ref="JMS_Config" destination="test.out"/>
		<raise-error type="APP:SOME"/>
		<!-- More Processors -->
	</try>
	<!-- Processors -->
	<error-handler>
		<on-error-continue/>
	</error-handler>
</flow>
----

The behavior in this scenario is:

* Ignore (`INDIFFERENT`): The transaction is _continued_. This time, the commit of the `jms:publish` message depends on the flow. Because the error is now handled by an `on-error-continue` error handler, the transaction is committed. The message read from the `jms:listener` source is consumed, and the message processed by the `jms:publish` is actually sent.
* Always Begin (`ALWAYS_BEGIN`): This raises an error because an active transaction already exists.
* Begin or Join (`BEGIN_OR_JOIN`): Same behavior as `INDIFFERENT`.

==== Error Handler Inside the Try Scope

In this case, we add the error handler in the `try` Scope, and the error is thrown after the execution of the scope:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<flow name="someFlow">
	<jms:listener config-ref="JMS_Config" destination="test.in" transactionalAction="ALWAYS_BEGIN"/>
	<!-- Processors -->
	<try transactionalAction="${action}">
		<!-- Processors -->
		<!-- Join if possible is the default value for jms:publish operation -->
		<jms:publish config-ref="JMS_Config" destination="test.out"/>
		<!-- More Processors -->
		<!-- There could be a processor that raises an error, it will be handled by the error handler -->
		<error-handler>
			<on-error-continue/>
		</error-handler>
	</try>
	<!-- Processors -->
	<raise-error type="APP:SOME"/>
</flow>
----

The behavior in the `try` Scope is:

* Ignore (`INDIFFERENT`): The transaction is _continued_ but the error is not handled by an `on-error-continue` at the flow level. This causes the transaction to be rolled back, and the message is not sent.
* Always Begin (`ALWAYS_BEGIN`): This raises an error because an active transaction already exists.
* Begin or Join (`BEGIN_OR_JOIN`): Same behavior as `INDIFFERENT`.

In all these cases the transaction created at flow level is rolled back, and the message remains available to be read again.

=== Configuring Local or XA Transactions

In addition to configuring the Transactional Action, you can also configure the Transaction Type to be Local (single Resource) or XA Transaction.

When setting the Transaction Type you must consider that a transaction cannot change it's type in the middle of its execution. This means that the Try Scope only uses the Transaction Type when a new transaction is created.

For each Transactional Action, the behavior changes:

* `INDIFFERENT`: The Transaction used is the one already created (if there is one). This means that setting the Transactional Type makes no difference for this Transactional Action.
* `ALWAYS_BEGIN`: The Transaction created is of the type set in the Transaction Type configuration. Remember that `ALWAYS_BEGIN` is an invalid configuration when already running within a Transaction.
* `BEGIN_OR_JOIN`: If there is a Transaction already created, then the Transactional Type makes no difference, as in the case of `INDIFFERENT`. If there is no Transaction, it creates one of the Type configured in Transaction Type, as in the case of `ALWAYS_BEGIN`.

== Variable and Payload Propagation

Every payload modification or variable addition, modification, or removal is propagated through the rest of the execution. This propagation includes modifications that take place inside the error handlers.
