The Try scope allows you to handle errors that may occur when attempting to execute any of the components inside the Try scope. It also supports transactions. A Try scope wraps one or more event processors, then catches and handles any exceptions that might be thrown by any of these enclosed event processors. The behavior is as if you extracted those enclosed event components into a separate flow with its own error handling strategy, but inline, without having to actually define a new flow.

== Error Handling with the Try Scope

The Try scope has its own error handling strategy that you configure in the same way you configure error handling for a flow. It supports error handling on its inner components instead of the entire flow so that you do not have to extract them into a separate flow.

Like all error handling, the Try scope can also distinguish between various error type conditions and apply different behaviors to each error type condition.

Just like any error that is raised inside a flow, if an error is raised by a component inside a Try scope, then the Try scope's error handler is executed, and the error is routed to the matching handler. At this point, the error is available for inspection, so the handlers can execute and act accordingly:

* An On Error Continue will execute and use the result of the execution as the result of its owner, as if the owner actually completed the execution successfully. Any transactions at this point are also committed.
* An On Error Propagate will roll back any transactions, execute, and use that result to rethrow the existing error, meaning that its owner will be considered as failing.

If the Try scope has several components, then once a component raises an exception, subsequent components in the Try scope are skipped, regardless of the type of error handler that catches the exception. In the case of On Error Propagate, the error is propagated to the flow's error handling, as if the Try scope did not exist. In the case of On Error Continue, processing continues outside the Try scope at the next downstream flow component, as if the Try scope never threw an exception.

In the example above, any database connection errors (DB:CONNECTIVITY) are propagated because of the On Error Propagate (`on-error-propagate`) setting. Propagation of this error causes the Try process to fail and the flowâ€™s error handler to execute. Other errors are handled through On Error Continue (`on-error-continue`), so the Try is treated as successful when they occur, meaning that the next processor, an HTTP request, continues to execute.



Within your flow, you can group a set of event processors that may throw an error inside a Try Scope. The Try Scope allows you enclose various event processors in your flow and assign it an Error Handler scope in case that operation may fail. +
You can also configure the operation inside the Try Scope to be processed as a transaction.


== Handling Transactions

You configure a Try scope so that it treats its child operations as an indivisible transaction. A transaction is a series of actions that should never be partially executed. Every operation within the scope of a transaction is executed in the same thread, and errors should lead to either a rollback or a commit.

image::error-handling-try-scope-config.png[Try Scope Configuration]

The Try scope treats child operations as a transaction when the Transactional Action (`transactionalAction`) is set to `ALWAYS_BEGIN` or `BEGIN_OR_JOIN`. It can be configured in the following ways:

* Ignore (`INDIFFERENT`):
+
Default. Actions are not treated as a transaction. Errors cause no rollbacks or commits. This is the equivalent to suspend the transaction.

* Always Begin (`ALWAYS_BEGIN`)
+
A new transaction is started every time the scope is executed.

* Begin or Join (`BEGIN_OR_JOIN`)
+
Only relevant in cases where execution order may vary (for example, due to asynchronous actions occurring outside the flow): If the current processing of the flow has already begun a transaction, join it. Otherwise, begin a new one.

=== Analyzing Different Transactional Actions in Try Scope

Suppose we have the next configuration: 

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<flow name="someFlow">
	<jms:listener config-ref="JMS_Config" destination="test.in" transactionalAction="ALWAYS_BEGIN"/>
	<!-- Processors -->
	<try transactionalAction="${action}">
		<!-- Processors -->
		<!-- Join if possible is the default value for jms:publish operation --> 
		<jms:publish config-ref="JMS_Config" destination="test.out"/>
		<raise-error type="APP:SOME"/>
		<!-- More Processors -->
	</try>
	<!-- Processors -->
</flow>
----

As expected, If the processors within the Try Scope do not produce any error, the scope finishes the execution and commits the transaction, independently of the configured `transactionalAction` value. 

We will analyze what happens with the transaction and messages with the `<raise-error/>` processor added, depending on the `transactionalAction` of the Try Scope: 

* Ignore (`INDIFFERENT`): in this case, the transaction is _suspended_ while executing the Try Scope inner processors. When the error is raised, it is propagated to the source (which does not handle it with an `<on-error-continue>`). So, the transaction is rolled back, and the message will be available again in the JMS queue. However, the `jms:publish` operation was completed and the message has been sent, since the rollback of the transaction does not affect the publish operation, which was outside of the transaction scope (even though the `transactionalAction` of the `jms:publish` operation is `BEGIN_OR_JOIN`). This will behave the same as if, instead of having a Try Scope with a `transactionalAction="INDIFFERENT"`, we had the `jms:publish` with `transactionalAction="NOT_SUPPORTED"`. 
* Always Begin (`ALWAYS_BEGIN`): in this case a new transaction is initiated for the execution of the try scope. After the error is raised (and not handled), the new transaction is rolled back, which means that the `jms:publish` operation is not committed and thus the message is not actually sent to the `test.out` queue. Then, the transaction of the flow (which was began by the message source) is also rolled back, and the message is available again in the `test.in` queue. 
* Begin or Join (`BEGIN_OR_JOIN`): in this case, when the error is raised, it is not inmediately rolled back. Since the flow might be able to handle the raised error and commit the transaction, the `jms:publish` operation can still complete and send the message. This time, since the error is not handled with an `on-error-continue`, then the entire transaction is rolled back and the result is the same as in the case of Always Begin. 

Suppose now we add an Error Handler at flow level:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<flow name="someFlow">
	<jms:listener config-ref="JMS_Config" destination="test.in" transactionalAction="ALWAYS_BEGIN"/>
	<!-- Processors -->
	<try transactionalAction="${action}">
		<!-- Processors -->
		<!-- Join if possible is the default value for jms:publish operation --> 
		<jms:publish config-ref="JMS_Config" destination="test.out"/>
		<raise-error type="APP:SOME"/>
		<!-- More Processors -->
	</try>
	<!-- Processors -->
	<error-handler>
		<on-error-continue/>
	</error-handler>
</flow>
----

We analyze this new scenario: 
* Ignore (`INDIFFERENT`): Once again, the transaction is _suspended_, and the message is sent in the `jms:publish` operation regardless of the error caused by the `raise-error` processor. Then, as the error is handled in the `on-error-continue` Error Handler, the transaction is committed and the message is consumed. 
* Always Begin (`ALWAYS_BEGIN`): Since the transaction that runs within the Try Scope is a different one from the flow, this one is rolled back (since it is not handled) and the error propagated and handled at flow level. Therefore, the message will still be consumed, but the message sent with the `jms:publish` operation not (that transaction is rolled back)
* Begin or Join (`BEGIN_OR_JOIN`): As mentioned in the previous example, the commit of the `jms:publish` message depends on the flow. Since the error is now handled by an `on-error-continue` Error Handler, the transaction is committed. Thus, both the message read from the `jms:listener` source is consumed and the message sent with `jms:publish` is actually sent.

Suppose now, instead of adding an Error Handler at flow level, we add it in the Try Scope, and the error is thrown 
after the execution of the scope:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<flow name="someFlow">
	<jms:listener config-ref="JMS_Config" destination="test.in" transactionalAction="ALWAYS_BEGIN"/>
	<!-- Processors -->
	<try transactionalAction="${action}">
		<!-- Processors -->
		<!-- Join if possible is the default value for jms:publish operation --> 
		<jms:publish config-ref="JMS_Config" destination="test.out"/>
		<!-- More Processors -->
		<!-- There could be a processor that raises an error, it will be handled by the error handler --> 
		<error-handler>
			<on-error-continue/>
		</error-handler>
	</try>
	<!-- Processors -->
	<raise-error type="APP:SOME"/>
</flow>
----

In all these cases the transaction created at Flow level will be rolled back, and the message will be available to be read again. We analyze what happens with the Try Scope:

* Ignore (`INDIFFERENT`): Once again, the transaction is _suspended_, and the message is sent in the `jms:publish` operation regardless of the error caused by the `raise-error` processor. 
* Always Begin (`ALWAYS_BEGIN`): Since the transaction that runs within the Try Scope is a different one from the flow, this one is committed, and the message sent. 
* Begin or Join (`BEGIN_OR_JOIN`): Now, the `jms:publish` operation is tied to the commit of the flow transaction, even if the Try Scope have finished its execution. Considering that the error raised in the flow is not handled (with an `on-error-continue`) and the transaction is rolled back, this includes rollbacking the `jms:publish` operation and not sending the message. 


== Variable and Payload Propagation

Every payload modification or variable addition, modification, or removal is propagated through the rest of the execution. This propagation includes modifications that take place inside the error handlers.
