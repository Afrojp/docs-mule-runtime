Out of the box, Mule provides several tools to ensure the security of applications:

* xref:configuring-the-spring-security-manager.adoc[Mule Security Manager], client authentication and authorization on inbound requests as well as credential mapping for outbound calls
* xref:ldap-connector.adoc[LDAP] and third party identity management system integration
* xref:enabling-ws-security.adoc[Validation of inbound requests] through the SAML 2.0 federated identity standard
* xref:sftp-transport-reference.adoc[Secure FTP (SFTP) Transport] that enables Mule flows to read and write to remote directories over the SSH protocol.

Beyond the out-of-the-box features, xref:anypoint-enterprise-security.adoc[Anypoint Enterprise Security], a separate, downloadable module, is a collection of security features that enforces secure access to information in Mule applications. Available as a module to download on your existing instance of Mule Enterprise, this suite of security features provides various methods for applying security to integration applications and Web services. The following security features bridge gaps between trust boundaries in applications:

  * Mule Secure Token Service (STS) Oauth 2.0 Provider
  * Secure Configuration Properties
  * Mule Cryptography Module
  * Mule Validation Module

== Features Summary

Anypoint Enterprise Security offers developers four tools to ensure that authorized end users have secure access to protected data. Each tool plays a different role in securing a Mule application.

== *Mule Secure Token Service Oauth 2.0 Provider*

Mule can apply Oauth 2.0 security to a REST Web service provider or consumer. OAuth uses tokens to ensure that a resource owner never has to share credentials, such as a username or password, with a 3rd-party Web service.

For example, Facebook uses OAuth to connect to Gmail to collect a user’s Gmail contacts. When a user initiates the request to connect, Facebook opens a new browser window for the user to enter a Gmail address and password. If authenticated, Gmail provides all the user’s contacts to Facebook, but does not share the user’s Gmail login credentials. OAuth ensures that the 3rd-party Facebook application never has access to the user’s protected Gmail credentials.

== Secure Configuration Properties

Mule can encrypt properties in a properties file. The properties file in Mule stores data as key-value pairs. Mule flows may access this data — usernames, first and last names, credit card information — as the flow processes messages. Much more detailed information about using encrypted properties files is available in the Secure Configuration Properties  documentation.

== Mule Cryptography Module

Mule Cryptography Module provides Mule applications with cryptographic capabilities and strategies. It allows for both, symmetric and asymmetric message encryption/decryption, as well as message signature and signature authentication. This allows mule apps to guarantee message security - no interceptor can read messages unless they possess a decryption key - and integrity - messages cannot be intercepted and altered in any way, unbeknown to us.

== Mule Validation Module

Mule Validation Module enables users to require that mule messages meet specific sets of rules or criteria, or to propagate an appropriate exception message when they don't. This module provides a wide set of validation filters — check for null, not null or numeric payloads for example.
