= For Each Scope
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]
include::_attributes.adoc[]
endif::[]

The For Each scope (`foreach`) splits a payload into elements and processes them one by one through the components that you place in the scope. It is similar to a for-each/for-loop code block in most programming languages.

It can process any collection, including lists and arrays. The collection can be any supported content type, such as `application/json`, `application/java`, or `application/xml`.

* By default For Each tries to split the payload. If the payload is a simple Java collection, the For Each scope can split it without any configuration.
* For Each will not modify the current payload.
* For non-Java collections, such as XML or JSON, you need to use a DateWeave expression to split data. You use the Collection (`collection`) field for this purpose.
+
Here, the Collection field in For Each is set to iterate over an array stored in `payload.topics`.

////
Note that if the input contains information outside the collection you tell it to split, this information is lost.
////

You can also split an array in batches. Potentially, batches produce quicker processing. Each batch is treated as a separate Mule message. For example, if a collection has 200 elements and you set Batch Size (`batchSize`) to `50`, the For Each scope iteratively processes 4 batches of 50 elements, each as a separate Mule message.

== Variable Propagation

Every execution of the ForEach scope will start with the same variables and values as before the execution of the block. New variables or modifications of already existing ones while processing one element will not be visible while processing another element. All of those variable changes will not be avaiable outside the ForEach scope. In other words, the set of variables (and their values) after the execution of the ForEach Scope will remain the same as before the execution of it.

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<set-variable variableName="var1" value="var1"/>
<set-variable variableName="var2" value="var2"/>
<foreach #[['apple', 'banana', 'orange']]>
    <choice>
        <when expression="#[payload == 'apple']">
            <set-variable variableName="var2" value="newValue"/>
            <set-variable variableName="var3" value="appleVal"/>
        </when>
        <when expression="#[payload == 'banana']">
            <set-variable variableName="var3" value="bananaVal"/>
        </when>
        <otherwise>
            <set-variable variableName="var3" value="otherVal"/>
            <set-variable variableName="var4" value="val4"/>
        </otherwise>
    </choice>
</foreach>
----

After aggregation, the variables are:

`{var1: "var1", var2: "var2"}`

None of the modifications are registered, including the creation of new variables. 

== Error Handling

If one of the elements in a collection throws an exception, the For Each scope stops processing that collection and invokes the error handler.

== Examples

There are several example projects in Anypoint Exchange that you can open in Anypoint Studio to learn more about how to use the For Each scope:

* _Authenticating Salesforce using OAuth2_
* _Import contacts into Microsoft Dynamics CRM_
* _Importing a CSV file into mongoDB_
* _Importing an Email Attachment using the IMAP Connector_
* _Importing Email Attachments using the POP3 Connector_
* _Querying a Database and Attaching Results to an Email_

To download and open an example project while you are in Anypoint Studio, click the Exchange icon in the upper-left corner. Then, in the window that opens, log into Anypoint Exchange and search on the name of the project.

=== Iterate a JSON Array

[source,xml,linenums]
----
include::{examplesdir}/for-each-scope-concept_1.xml[]
----

In this case, the payload contains a JSON array. For Each iterates over the payload because the `collection` attribute has not been defined. The payload within For Each is each of the users in the JSON array.

=== Iterate over a Java Map that is Placed in a Variable

[source,xml,linenums]
----
include::{examplesdir}/for-each-scope-concept_2.xml[]
----

The example uses the `ee:transform` to set a variable named `users` with a Java map that is created with DataWeave. Then it uses a built-in DataWeave function to get the entries of a map as a collection in order to iterate over it.

=== Split a Collection into Batches

[source,xml,linenums]
----
include::{examplesdir}/for-each-scope-concept_3.xml[]
----

The `batchSize` attribute creates sub-arrays of two elements. So inside `foreach`, the payload will have an array of two elements.

=== Aggregate the Process of Each Element into a Variable

[source,xml,linenums]
----
include::{examplesdir}/for-each-scope-concept_4.xml[]
----

Within the For Each, the example creates an `aggregation` variable that concatenates the name in reverse. Then that variable can be accessed outside the For Each scope.

== Persisting Data

In case the message inside the For Each scope is persisted, not only the item in the collection is serialized but also all the variables associated with it. The rootMessage variable, associated with the message, contains a reference to the complete, unsplit collection. Therefore, serialization/deserialization of the rootMessage variable could impact memory consumption considerably when this collection is large enough.

To avoid this issue you must first remove the rootMessage variable from the message before persisting it.
