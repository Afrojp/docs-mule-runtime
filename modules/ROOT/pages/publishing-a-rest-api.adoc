Mule runtime engine provides a toolkit to facilitate the development and exposure of REST APIs. APIkit Rest is a simple framework that helps you with API-first development, enforcing good API implementation practices. +

Adding APIkit to your Anypoint Studio instance enables you to quickly and properly develop, document, and test your Mule APIs. You can reduce your API development time from weeks or months to days or hours.

Use APIkit to create an API based on RAML (RESTful API Modeling Language) or OAS (OpenAPI Specification) API definition. The toolkit produces a Mule application with an HTTP endpoint and exception strategies and also offers an API console as a design feature only, to test your API while developing.
