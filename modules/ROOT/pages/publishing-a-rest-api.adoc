Mule provides a dedicated toolkit to facilitate the development and exposure of REST APIs. APIkit Rest is a simple framework that helps you with API-first development, enforcing good API implementation practices. You can add this toolkit to your instance of Anypoint Studio. +

Rather than spending weeks or months building an API, you can use this toolkit to develop, document, and test your API within a few days or even hours.

Use APIkit to create an API based on RAML (RESTful API Modeling Language) or OAS (OpenAPI Specification) API definition. The toolkit produces a Mule application with an HTTP endpoint and exception strategies and also offers an API console as a design feature only, to test your API while developing.
