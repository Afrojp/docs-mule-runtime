Learn about common development strategies and best practices that can help you develop Mule applications.

== Create Reproducible Builds
Create reproducible builds to facilitate the maintenance of your applications, by running a particular version of your Mule projects at any time. You can achieve this goal:

* Using source control for your Mule projects
* Managing dependencies using Maven and an in-house manager. +

For details see xref:reproducible-builds.adoc[Reproducible Builds] documentation.

== Implement Reliability Patterns
Implement a reliability pattern to design your applications so they are capable of reliable messaging, even if the applications receive messages from a nontransactional connector. A reliability pattern design couples a reliable acquisition flow with an application logic flow. +

For details see xref:reliability-patterns.adoc[Implement Reliability Patterns] documentation.


== Implement Transaction Management
Implement transaction operations in a Mule app for which the result cannot remain indeterminate. When a series of steps in a flow must succeed or fail as one unit, Mule uses a transaction to demarcate that unit. +
For details on the different transaction types, transaction actions operations and how you can configure a transaction in a message source or Try Scope in the xref:transaction-management.adoc[Implement Transaction Management] documentation. +
Additionally, you can implement xref:single-resource-transaction.adoc[Single Source Transactions], xref:xa-transactions.adoc[XA Transactions] and xref:using-bitronix-to-manage-transactions.adoc[use Britonix to manage transactions].

== Modularize Configurations Files
Modularize configuration files by splitting monolithic configurations into several files, and leverage Muleâ€™s capacity to load multiple configuration files at application start-up time. Although it might seem convenient to keep your Mule configurations in one file, a very large XML file quickly becomes unmanageable. There are two options to load multiple configuration files:

* Side-by-side: Provide a list of independent configuration files to load.
* Imported: Have one configuration file import several others, which in turn, can import other files. +

For details see xref:modularizing-your-configuration-files-for-team-development.adoc[Modularize Configurations Files] documentation.

== Implement Continuous Integration
Implement continuous integration (CI) for your projects by using Maven as your build tool. Create a build that gets triggered on every project change, and run all of its unit and functional tests automatically. By doing so you can:
Get early notification of issues in the software development lifecycle.
Ensure code gets fully tested before release.
Confirm that successfully tested branches ensure better success when merging to the master branch. +
For details see xref:continuous-integration.adoc[Continuous Integration] documentation.

== Implement Orchestration in Mule
Implement orchestration is Mule to facilitate the process of moving data through a Mule implementation based on flows. The orchestration implements business-level processes combining business-specific services across applications and information systems.
Flows uses cases that orchestrate are:

* Simple integration.
* Scheduling data processing.
* Connecting cloud and on-premise applications.
* Event processing, where multiple services must be composed and must operate simultaneously. +

For details see xref:understanding-orchestration-using-mule.adoc[Implement Orchestration in Mule] documentation.

== Implement Enterprise Integration Patterns
Implement enterprise integration patterns as solutions for designing, building messaging and integration systems, as well as a common language for teams to use when architecting solutions.
Mule reduces the effort required when building integrations by implementing the patterns that you use to design solutions. +
For details see xref:understanding-enterprise-integration-patterns-using-mule.adoc[Implement Enterprise Integration Patterns] documentation.
