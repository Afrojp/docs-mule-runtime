Microsoft Azure Service Bus Connector version 2.0.0

The Azure Service Bus connector enables message integration with Azure Service Bus on the cloud. This connector supports communication with queues and topics. In addition, you can use the built-in management API to discover Azure Service Bus objects automatically and to provision them.

== Prerequisites

This document assumes that you are familiar with Mule, Anypoint Connectors, Anypoint Studio, Mule concepts, elements in a Mule flow, and Global Elements.

You need login credentials to test your connection with your target resource. You can use Basic Authentication, or you can pass credentials in a connection string.

For software requirements and compatibility
information, see the connector's release notes.

== To Install the Connector in Anypoint Studio
. In Anypoint Studio, click the Exchange icon in the Studio task bar.
. Click *Login* in Anypoint Exchange.
. Search for the connector and click *Install*.
. Follow the prompts to install the connector.

When Studio has an update, a message displays in the lower right corner, which you can click to install the update.

== To Configure the Connector Using the Studio Visual Editor
. Drag and drop the HTTP connector onto the Studio canvas.

+
. To configure the HTTP connector, enter these values:
+
image::microsoft-azure-sb-httpListenerConfig.png[Http Listener configuration]
+
** *Protocol*: Protocol selected for the HTTP endpoint. This can be HTTP or HTTPS (secure).
** *Host*: IP address where the Mule application listens for requests.
** *Port*: Port where the Mule application listens for requests.
** *Base Path*: Path to the port where the Mule application listens for requests.
. Select the connector from palette.

=== Sources

==== Queue Listener Configuration

Configure the Queue Listener as follows:

image::microsoft-azure-sb-queuereceiver.png[Queue Source]

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Field |Description
|*Queue name* | Queue to receive events. To receive events from the dead letter queue, specify `QueueName/$deadletterqueue`.
|*Receive Mode*
a|
* MANUAL: User must manually acknowledge messages.
* AUTOMATIC: Message is acknowledged from the queue and then deleted from the queue after it is received.
If a message is not acknowledged, it times out and goes to the end of the queue.
|*Server timeout (ms)*| Maximum duration in milliseconds within which the client keeps renewing the message lock if the processing of the message is not completed by the handler.
|*Prefetch count*| When `Prefetch` is enabled in any of the official Service Bus clients, the receiver acquires additional messages, up to the `PrefetchCount` limit. This can be more messages than what the application initially requested. Set this field to 0 to disable prefetching.
|*Cron Expression*| (Optional) UNIX CRON expression that specifies when to trigger the receiver action. For example setting this field to `0 0 * * *`  triggers the receiver action at midnight (00:00) every day.
|*Max messages to receive*| Maximum number of messages to receive during the scheduled operation.
|===

==== Subscription Listener

Configure the Subscription Listener as follows:

image::microsoft-azure-sb-topicreceiver.png[Topic Source]

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Field |Description
|*Topic* | Topic name to which to connect.
|*Subscription*| Subscription to receive events. To receive events from the dead letter queue, specify `QueueName/$deadletterqueue`.
|*Receive Mode*
a|
* MANUAL: User must manually acknowledge messages.
* AUTOMATIC: Message is acknowledged from the queue and then deleted from the queue after it is received.
If a message is not acknowledged, it times out and goes to the end of the queue.
|*Server timeout (ms)*| Maximum duration within which the client keeps renewing the message lock if the processing of the message is not completed by the handler.
|*Prefetch Count*| When `Prefetch` is enabled in any of the official Service Bus clients, the receiver acquires additional messages, up to the `PrefetchCount` limit. This can be more messages than what the application initially requested. Set this field to 0 to disable prefetching.
|*Cron Expression*| (Optional) UNIX CRON expression that specifies when to trigger the receiver action. For example, setting this field to `0 0 * * *`  triggers the receiver action at midnight (00:00) every day.
|*Max. Messages to Receive*| Maximum number of messages to receive during the scheduled operation.

== Use Case: Studio

=== Get Queue list

image::microsoft-azure-sb-flow.png[General]

. Create a new Mule application in Studio, and select an HTTP Connector as a source in the new flow.
. Add a new HTTP Connector Configuration global element:
.. Enter the following values for the `Host` and `Port` fields:
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Parameter |Value
|*Host* |0.0.0.0
|*Port* |8081
|===
+
.. Click *Save*.
. Assign the Global configuration to the HTTP Listener.
. In the *Path* field for the HTTP Listener path, enter `/list`.
. Drag and drop a new *Microsoft Azure Service Bus* component on the flow.
. Configure the Microsoft Azure Service Bus connector global element with its environment values.
. Select the `List queues` operation in the dropdown option.
. Save and run the project as a Mule Application.

== Use Case: XML

== Additional Information

=== Queue and Subscription Listener Operations

The output payload is a string with the message. Additional attributes are returned in the Outbound Properties.

=== Using Restricted Access Policies

In situations where you have restricted access to your resources (to only send/receive amqps messages), enable the option *AMQPS-only credentials* inside the *Advanced* tab.

=== Handling a very high number of messages

When handling a very high number of messages (thousands per second), especially if publishing to and reading from the same destination within the same Mule application, you may see messages like this in the log:

```
[ERROR 2019-05-22 00:15:26,362 [ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-3] com.microsoft.azure.servicebus.MessageAndSessionPump: onMessage with message containing sequence number '95' threw exception com.mulesoft.connectors.microsoft.azure.servicebus.internal.error.exception.ConsumerException: Failed setting attributes from original API message.]
```
This problem is related to the processing strategy that Mule resolves automatically to "queue-asynchronous" when you configure the message listener in a flow.
If a message is waiting for more than 30,000 ms to be processed by the flow, an exception is thrown and that causes an error (timeout in the mule SEDA queue).
To avoid the error, you can create a custom queue-asynchronic configuration and increase the number of threads (`maxThreads` property, default 16) and / or increase the waiting time (`threadWaitTimeout`, default 30,000 ms). This configuration can be modified by selecting the flow, and within General -> Optional Processing Strategy -> Processing Strategy Ref, add a new Queued Asynchronous Processing Strategy.

More information: https://docs.mulesoft.com/mule-runtime/3.7/flow-processing-strategies#fine-tuning-a-queued-asynchronous-processing-strategy

=== Random errors when using manual ACK

You may see errors like this one when working with a high number of messages and using manual ACK:

```
[com.mulesoft.connectors.microsoft.azure.servicebus.internal.error.exception.ConsumerException: Message with lockToken 2dc1312f-b263-4282-bbb0-566998eff6e6 could not be ACK at com.mulesoft.connectors.microsoft.azure.servicebus.internal.connection.Connection.ack(Connection.java:192)][ERROR 2019-05-22 00:17:30,822 [ReactorThread6f355ff5-5a36-487b-bb70-1a995a6ddf74] com.microsoft.azure.servicebus.primitives.CoreMessageReceiver: Completing pending updateState operation for delivery '?     ? &??I??=????' with exception com.microsoft.azure.servicebus.primitives.MessageLockLostException: The lock supplied is invalid. Either the lock expired, or the message has already been removed from the queue.]
```
When the connector performs a "prefetch", the lockToken's validity time is fixed in relation to that moment. The problem arises when the lockToken's validity time is not long enough to process the entire batch of records. In cases like this you may get an error because you intend to do an ACK of a lockToken that is expired. To prevent this, you can reduce the size of the prefetch (default to 100) and / or increase the validity time of the lockToken (this can be done when creating the queue/subscription from the connector, in the lock duration property or from Azure portal for existing queues). The maximum duration value for the lock token in Azure is 5 minutes (300 seconds).
