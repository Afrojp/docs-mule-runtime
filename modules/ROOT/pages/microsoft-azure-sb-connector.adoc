Microsoft Azure Service Bus Connector version 2.0.0

The Azure Service Bus connector enables message integration with Azure Service Bus on the cloud. This connector supports communication with queues and topics. In addition, you can use the built-in management API to discover Azure Service Bus objects automatically and to provision them.

== Prerequisites

This document assumes that you are familiar with Mule, Anypoint Connectors, Anypoint Studio, Mule concepts, elements in a Mule flow, and Global Elements.

You need login credentials to test your connection with your target resource. You can use Basic Authentication, or you can pass credentials in a connection string.

For software requirements and compatibility
information, see the connector's release notes.

== Install the Connector in Anypoint Studio
. In Anypoint Studio, click the Exchange icon in the Studio task bar.
. Click *Login* in Anypoint Exchange.
. Search for the connector and click *Install*.
. Follow the prompts to install the connector.

== Use Cases

=== Send a Message to a Queue or Topic

The following Mule app sends a message to a queue. You can create a similar Mule app to send a message to a topic:

. Create a new Mule app in Studio.
. Add an *HTTP Connector* as the source of the flow. Set the *Port* to 8081 and the *Path* to `/send`.
. Add a *Set Payload* or *Transform Message*, and create a message to enqueue .
. Drag a *Microsoft Azure Service Bus* connector to the flow, and configure the connector.
.. Set the "Publish message" operation, the "Destination Type" (`QUEUE` or `TOPIC`) and the "Destination name".
. Since the "Publish message" operation has no return value, use another *Set Payload* to return a message: `#["message sent"]`.

When you call `http://localhost:8081/send`, a message is uploaded to the queue.

=== Receive messages from a Queue with a Manual ACK

. Create a new Mule app in Studio.
. Add and configure *Microsoft Azure Service Bus* as the source of the flow.
.. Set it to use the "Queue listener". For topics, use "Subscription listener".
.. Set the "Queue name" to the desired destination, and "Receive mode" to `MANUAL`.
. Drag a *Variable* component to store the *Lock Token* from the received message, with this expression: `#[message.inboundProperties.get('lockToken')]`.
. Do something with the message. For testing purposes, a simple *Logger* would suffice.
. Add another *Microsoft Azure Service Bus*. Set it to call the "Acknowledge message" operation. For the "Lock" parameter, retrieve the *Lock Token* stored before.

Every message received will be processed. If said processing is successful, it will be acknowledged.

For automatic ACK, set the "Receive mode" to `AUTOMATIC`. No need to manually handle the "Lock token" or call the "Acknowledge message" operation.

=== Scheduled Reception of Messages

. Set up a Mule application to receive messages from a queue or topic as you would normally do.
. Observe that the "Queue listener" and "Subscription listener" have two extra parameters: "CRON expression" and "Max. messages to receive".
.. Set the "CRON expression" following the UNIX standard. For example, to connect and receive messages every day at 8 AM, use `0 8 * * *`.
.. Set "Max. messages to receive" to the maximum number of messages you wish the connector to receive every time a receive is triggered by the CRON expression.

The connector will do a batch receive every time the CRON expression commands it. Any number of available messages up to the maximum set will be retrieved and processed by the flow.

== Queue Send Batch

. Start with the simple application created with the instructions. under the *Send message to Queue or Topic* title.
. Replace the call to the "Publish message" operation with "Publish batch of messages". Make sure the "Destination type" and "Destination name" are properly set.
. When crafting the message, be sure to create a list of strings, instead of only one, since we are sending many messages at once. For example. To split a string by the commas, and send every piece as an individual message, drag a *Transform message* and use the following script:
```
%dw 1.0
%output application/java
---
payload splitBy ','
```

=== Schedule the logical enqueuing of a message

To send a message to the queue or topic and have the message dispatched to its listeners at a specified time:name: value

. Start with the simple application created with the instructions. under the *Send message to Queue or Topic* title.
. Fill in the "Scheduled enqueue time UTC" of the "Publish message" call parameter with the date/time you want the message to be dispatched. Format example: `2019-06-27T21:16:46.866Z`.

The message will be sent to the destination, which will not dispatch it immediately, but at the specified time.

== REST operations

The connector also supports Service Bus' REST API for queue, topic, subscription and rules management. These are the available operations:

* Queue
** Create
** Get
** Get Size
** List
** Update
** Delete
* Topic
** Create
** Get
** List
** Update
** Delete
* Subscription
** Create
** Get
** Get Size
** List
** Update
** Delete
* Rule
** Create
** Get
** List
** Update
** Delete

== Additional Information

=== Queue and Subscription Listener Operations

The output payload is a string with the message.
Additional attributes are returned in the Outbound Properties.

=== Using Restricted Access Policies

In situations where you have restricted access to your resources (to only send/receive amqps messages), enable the option *AMQP-only credentials* inside the *Advanced* tab.

=== Handling a Very High Number of Messages

When handling a very high number of messages (thousands per second), especially if publishing to and reading from the same destination within the same Mule app, you may see messages like this in the log:

```
[ERROR 2019-05-22 00:15:26,362 [ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-3] com.microsoft.azure.servicebus.MessageAndSessionPump: onMessage with message containing sequence number '95' threw exception com.mulesoft.connectors.microsoft.azure.servicebus.internal.error.exception.ConsumerException: Failed setting attributes from original API message.]
```
This problem relates to the processing strategy that Mule resolves automatically to "queue-asynchronous" when you configure the message listener in a flow.
If a message is waiting for more than 30,000 ms to be processed by the flow, Mule throws an exception, which causes an error (timeout in the mule SEDA queue).
To avoid this error, create a custom queue-asynchronic configuration and increase the number of threads (`maxThreads` property, default 16) and / or increase the waiting time (`threadWaitTimeout`, default 30,000 ms). To modify this configuration, select the flow, and within General -> Optional Processing Strategy -> Processing Strategy Ref, add a new Queued Asynchronous Processing Strategy.

For more information, see https://docs.mulesoft.com/mule-runtime/3.7/flow-processing-strategies#fine-tuning-a-queued-asynchronous-processing-strategy

=== Random Errors when Using a Manual ACK

You may see errors like this one when working with a high number of messages and using manual ACK:

```
[com.mulesoft.connectors.microsoft.azure.servicebus.internal.error.exception.ConsumerException: Message with lockToken 2dc1312f-b263-4282-bbb0-566998eff6e6 could not be ACK at com.mulesoft.connectors.microsoft.azure.servicebus.internal.connection.Connection.ack(Connection.java:192)][ERROR 2019-05-22 00:17:30,822 [ReactorThread6f355ff5-5a36-487b-bb70-1a995a6ddf74] com.microsoft.azure.servicebus.primitives.CoreMessageReceiver: Completing pending updateState operation for delivery '?     ? &??I??=????' with exception com.microsoft.azure.servicebus.primitives.MessageLockLostException: The lock supplied is invalid. Either the lock expired, or the message has already been removed from the queue.]
```
When the connector performs a "prefetch", the lockToken's validity time is fixed in relation to that moment. The problem arises when the lockToken's validity time is not long enough to process the entire batch of records. In these cases, you may get an error because you intend to do an ACK of a lockToken that is expired. To prevent this, reduce the size of the prefetch (default to 100) and / or increase the validity time of the lockToken (this can be done when creating the queue/subscription from the connector, in the lock duration property or from Azure portal for existing queues). The maximum duration value for the lock token in Azure is 5 minutes (300 seconds).

=== Reduce Noise in the Logs for Mule Apps

In some circumstances, the underlying library used by the connector regularly logs complete stacktraces with a WARN level. These messages do not represent an issue, but they can clutter the logs.
To reduce noise in the logs, there are two alternatives. Both require changes in the `src/main/resources/log4j2.xml` file:

* Specify an *AsyncLogger* for the library's package, raising the level of the log:

```
<!-- Recommended for packages not belonging to Mule -->
<AsyncLogger name="com.microsoft.azure.servicebus" level="ERROR"/>
```

* Add a *RegexFilter* to the existing appender (for example, RollingFile):

```
<!-- Avoids the log of messages that contain the specified regexp -->
<RegexFilter regex = ".message to filter.*" onMatch="DENY" onMismatch="ACCEPT"/>
```
*IMPORTANT: If the message is multiline it may not work correctly (RegexFilter).*

=== Listeners (Sources) in Network Disconnection and Reconnection Scenarios

In situations with network connection problems, if you want the Listeners (Sources) components in the Azure connector to automatically execute reconnection attempts, you must specify a reconnection strategy. Specify the reconnection strategy when creating or editing the *'Connector Configuration'* in the Azure connector (parameter group: *'Basic Settings'*). In the *'Connector Configuration'* pop-up screen, access the *'Reconnection'* tab and select a *'Standard Reconnection'* strategy. There we could indicate the *'Frequency (ms)'* of the check and the number of *'Reconnection Attempts'*.
