Microsoft Azure Service Bus Connector version 2.0.0

The Azure Service Bus connector enables message integration with Azure Service Bus on the cloud. This connector supports communication with queues and topics. In addition, you can use the built-in management API to discover Azure Service Bus objects automatically and to provision them.

== Prerequisites

This document assumes that you are familiar with Mule, Anypoint Connectors, Anypoint Studio, Mule concepts, elements in a Mule flow, and Global Elements.

You need login credentials to test your connection with your target resource. You can use Basic Authentication, or you can pass credentials in a connection string.

For hardware and software requirements and compatibility
information, see the Connector Release Notes.

== To Connect in Anypoint Studio

=== Configuration
. To install a connector, see xref:installing-connectors.adoc[Installing Connectors].
. Drag and drop an HTTP Listener onto the Studio canvas.
+
image::microsoft-azure-sb-listener.png[Trigger options]
+
. To create an HTTP Listener configuration for the connector, enter values for these fields:
+
image::microsoft-azure-sb-httpListenerConfig.png[Http Listener configuration]
+
** *Protocol*: Protocol selected for the HTTP endpoint. This can be HTTP or HTTPS (secure).
** *Host*: IP address where the Mule application listens for requests.
** *Port*: Port where the Mule application listens for requests.
** *Base Path*: Path where the Mule application listens for requests.
. Select the connector from palette.
+
image::microsoft-azure-sb-palette.png[add connector]
+
. Drag and drop the connector onto the canvas.
. Configure one of global elements for the connector:
+
image::microsoft-azure-config.png[Configuration]
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|===
+

** Basic Authentication:
+
image::microsoft-azure-sb-userandpassword.png[General]
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Field |Description
|*Key Name* | Name of the access key configured on the Azure Service Bus namespace. An access key created at a lower level, such as a topic-level shared key, does not work with this option unless you disable the connectivity test at startup.
|*Shared Access Key* | 56-bit primary key.
|*Service namespace*| Name of the service namespace to address Azure Service Bus resources within your application.

|===

** Connection string:
+
image::microsoft-azure-sb-cs.png[General]
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Field |Description
|*Connection String* | Link provided by the Microsoft Azure portal that contains all needed connection parameters.
|*Service Namespace* | Name of the service namespace to address Service Bus resources within your application.
|===

=== Sources

==== Queue Listener Configuration

Configure the Queue Listener as follows:

image::microsoft-azure-sb-queuereceiver.png[Queue Source]

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Field |Description
|*Queue name* | Queue to receive events. To receive events from the dead letter queue, specify `QueueName/$deadletterqueue`.
|*Receive Mode*
a|
* MANUAL: User must manually acknowledge messages.
* AUTOMATIC: Message is acknowledged from the queue and then deleted from the queue after it is received.
If a message is not acknowledged, it times out and goes to the end of the queue.
|*Server timeout (ms)*| Maximum duration within which the client keeps renewing the message lock if the processing of the message is not completed by the handler.
|*Prefetch count*| When `Prefetch` is enabled in any of the official Service Bus clients, the receiver acquires additional messages, up to the `PrefetchCount` limit. This can be more messages than what the application initially requested. Set this field to 0 to disable prefetching.
|*Cron Expression*| (Optional) UNIX CRON expression that specifies when to trigger the receiver action. For example setting this field to `0 0 * * *`  triggers the receiver action at midnight (00:00) every day.
|*Max messages to receive*| Maximum number of messages to receive during the scheduled operation.
|===

==== Subscription Listener

Configure the Subscription Listener as follows:

image::microsoft-azure-sb-topicreceiver.png[Topic Source]

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Field |Description
|*Topic name* | Topic name to connect.
|*Subscription name*| Subscription to receive events. To receive events from the dead letter queue, specify `QueueName/$deadletterqueue`.
|*Receive Mode*
a|
* MANUAL: User must manually acknowledge messages.
* AUTOMATIC: Message is acknowledged from the queue and then deleted from the queue after it is received.
If a message is not acknowledged, it times out and goes to the end of the queue.
|*Server timeout (ms)*| Maximum duration within which the client keeps renewing the message lock if the processing of the message is not completed by the handler.
|*Prefetch count*| When `Prefetch` is enabled in any of the official Service Bus clients, the receiver acquires additional messages, up to the `PrefetchCount` limit. This can be more messages than what the application initially requested. Set this field to 0 to disable prefetching.
|*Cron Expression*| (Optional) UNIX CRON expression that specifies when to trigger the receiver action. For example setting this field to `0 0 * * *`  triggers the receiver action at midnight (00:00) every day.
|*Max messages to receive*| Maximum number of messages to receive during the scheduled operation.

== Use Case: Studio

=== Get Queue list

image::microsoft-azure-sb-flow.png[General]

. Create a new Mule application on Studio, and select an HTTP Listener as a source in the new flow.
. Add a new HTTP Listener Configuration global element:
.. Enter the following values for the *Host* and *Port* fields:
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Parameter |Value
|*Host* |0.0.0.0
|*Port* |8081
|===
+
.. Click *Save*.
. Assign the Global configuration to the HTTP Listener.
. Add HTTP Listener path with `/list` value.
. Drag and drop a new *Azure Service Bus* component on the flow.
. Configure the Azure Service Bus connector global element with its environment values.
. Select `List queues` operation in the dropdown option.
* Save and run the project as a Mule Application.

== Use Case: XML

== Additional information

=== Queue/Subscription listener operations

The output payload is a String with the message. Additional attributes are returned in the Outbound Properties.

=== Using restricted access policies

In situations where you have restricted access to your resources (only send/receive amqps messages), enable the option *AMQPS-only credentials* inside the *Advanced* tab.
