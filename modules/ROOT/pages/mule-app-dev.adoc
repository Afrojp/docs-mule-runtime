Mule applications implement your data integrations, typically by reading data from
internal and external sources, processing and transforming data to the required
formats and structures, and writing that output to the systems and servers where
you store and use the transformed data.

== Getting Started

To get started with Mule application development, you can follow the steps
in these tutorials:

* xref:mule-app-dev-hellomule.adoc[Hello Mule Tutorial]:
Build a Mule application that interacts with a user in a simple HTTP
request-response flow.
* xref:mule-app-tutorial.adoc[Mule App Development Tutorial]:
Build a Mule application that retrieves data from a database and transforms the
to a new structure.

== Building Blocks of a Mule Application

Mule applications use connectors, modules, and components to read, write,
and process data.

* xref:connectors::index.adoc[Connectors and Modules]: Anypoint connectors
interact with external API endpoints, while Validation, Java, Spring, OAuth
and other modules extend the functionality of a Mule application.
+
* xref:about-components.adoc[Core Components]: Configure flow control,
error handling, logging, batch, and other programmatic operations into your
application.

== DataWeave

DataWeave is the primary language used for formulating expressions in Mule.
Connectors, modules, and components support the use of DataWeave to access,
manipulate and transform data structures and output formats, and extract data
from the Mule event. DataWeave
data structures and transform data to the structures and
formats that you need as it travels through a Mule application.
Within fields of many message processing components, in addition to the
Transform Message component, you can use DataWeave
* xref:dataweave.adoc[DataWeave]: support
the use of DataWeave expressions and scripts to select and transform data to

At runtime, Mule evaluates expressions while executing a flow to:

* Extract data needed to process the current message.
* Set or manipulate a value in the message.

[[flows]]
=== Mule Flows

Understanding basic flow architecture is key to understanding a Mule application.
Essentially, every Mule flow contains a series of components that receive or
process messages.

.Simple Flow in Design Center
image::flow-example.png[Simple Flow in Design Center]

At the simplest level, flows are sequences of Event processors. A message
that enters a flow can pass through a variety of processors. In a typical
flow, a Mule application receives a message through an Event source (such as an
HTTP listener), transforms that message into a new format, and processes
any business logic before writing the processed message to an external
system in a format that the system can read.

To break up processing into more manageable units, Mule apps often contain
multiple, interrelated flows, instead of just a single flow. A flow can call
another flow as a direct reference.

For more on this topic, see xref:about-flows.adoc[Flows and Subflows] and
xref:mule-components-overview.adoc[Mule Components].

=== Event Sources

An event source (or trigger) is the first component in a flow. It
receives a triggering event, creates a corresponding Mule event object,
and forwards that event on for processing by the next component in the flow.

External clients can trigger processing in a Mule flow through a number of
communication protocols and methods, such as JMS, HTTP, FTP, JDBC, or File.
Mule translates these communication protocols and methods into a standard
message format, which passes through the flow's Event processors.

Event sources in Mule can connect to specific external sources, either through
a standard protocol or a third-party API. It is also possible to set a Scheduler
component. Some schedulers can poll for specific changes to external resources,
such as new files or table rows in an external resource. Examples of listeners
and connector operations that can trigger a flow include:

* HTTP, JMS, VM listeners in their associated connectors
* On Table Row operation in the Database connector
* On New or Updated File operation in the File and FTP connectors
* Scheduler

Note that you can also create your own Event source using the
xref:mule-sdk::index.adoc[Mule SDK].

=== Event Processors

Once a flow is triggered through an Event source, subsequent components process
the Mule event as it travels through the flow. By default, each Event processor
that receives a Mule event returns a new Mule message, typically with a set
of attributes and the message payload that the processor returns. The processor
passes on the new message as output to the next processor in the flow.

Event processors available to Mule apps include:

* Operations from modules and connectors. Examples include reading from and
writing to an external resource and validating data in the Mule app.
+
Some operations can make client requests to external resources and services
(including external databases and systems, such as Salesforce, Workday,
ServiceNow, and many others) and to other Mule apps. Others can run your
custom code, support OAuth configurations, and handle communication through
asynchronous queues, for example. A variety of other operations are
available.
+
* Core components can route data, perform data transformations, handle errors
that might occur when processing the event, and perform other tasks in a
Mule app.
+
Transformers (such as the Transform Message, Set Variable, and others) are
key to exchanging data between nodes. Transformers enable Mule to convert
message data in the Mule event to a format that another application or service can
read.
+
Mule also enables content enrichment of messages (through
xref:target-variables.adoc[Target Parameters]) so that you can retrieve
additional data and attach it to the message.

Note that you can also create your own Event processors using the
xref:mule-sdk::index.adoc[Mule SDK].

== Security

You can provide security to your Mule apps by encrypting properties, configuring
secure communications over TLS, setting up authentication over OAuth 2.0, and
providing cryptographic and other capabilities, such as FIPS compliance.

* xref:securing.adoc[Security]

== Development Environments

You can develop a Mule application using
xref:docs-studio::index.adoc[Anypoint Studio] (an Eclipse-based IDE),
xref:docs-design-center::about-designing-a-mule-application.adoc[Flow Designer]
(a Cloud-based application in Design Center, on Anypoint Platform),
or, if you are an advanced developer, in your own IDE.

For example, in Studio, you build and design a Mule application in a project
that contains one or more an XML-based files. A Mule project supports all the
dependencies required for development. The
xref:7.3@docs-studio::index.adoc#package-explorer[Package Explorer] in Studio
provides access to the project folders and files that make up a Mule project
support a design-time environment in which you can also build, run, and test
your Mule app. Flow Designer supports a Cloud-based version of a Mule project.

[[version]]
== Mule Versioning

The Mule version you use determines what your Mule app, domain, or policy can
do and what features and products are compatible with Mule.  For example,
xref:about-components.adoc[Core components], which process the Mule event
as it travels through flows in a Mule app, are part of a Core module that is
bundled with and shares the same version as Mule.
xref:connectors::index.adoc[Modules, connectors], the DataWeave language, and
a number of MuleSoft products have their own versioning system but are
compatible with specific versions of Mule. For example, DataWeave 2.0 and
Studio 7.x are compatible Mule 4.x runtimes, while DataWeave 1.0 and
Studio 6.x are compatible with Mule 3.x runtimes. You need to make sure the
connector or module you use in a Mule application is compatible with your Mule version.
