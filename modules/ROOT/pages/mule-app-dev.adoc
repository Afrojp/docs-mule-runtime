Mule applications enable you to perform data integrations for your use cases.
Typical Mule applications read data from internal and external sources,
process and transform data to the required formats and structures, and
write that output to the systems and servers where you store and use the
transformed data.

Important use cases and practices include:

* API orchestration, consumption, implementation, and proxying
* Logging, debugging, error handling
* Reuse of applications, fragments, and configurations
* Security of properties and communications
//NEED EXAMPLE:
//* Consuming other external services

== Getting Started

To get started with Mule application development, you can follow the steps
in these tutorials:

* xref:mule-app-dev-hellomule.adoc[Hello Mule Tutorial]:
Build a Mule application that interacts with a user in a simple HTTP request-response flow.
* xref:mule-app-tutorial.adoc[Mule App Development Tutorial]:
Build a Mule application that retrieves data from a database and transforms the
to a new structure.

You can also build Mule REST or SOAP APIs from an API specification using
APIKit, and your Mule app can incorporate a
connector, such as the Web Service Consumer connector or HTTP connector, that
consumes API data. You can also use incorporate connectors that are available
from Anypoint Exchange or use the Mule SDK to develop your own connector.

* xref:build-application-from-api.adoc[Build an Application from an API]
* xref:consume-data-from-an-api.adoc[Consume Data from an API]

== Building Blocks of a Mule Application

You can start a Mule app with or without an API specification, connect to
external data sources using connectors, process your data with Core components,
and create other configurations you need to complete your application.

* xref:connectors::index.adoc[Connectors and Modules]:
Interact with external API endpoints using pre-built Anypoint connectors, and
build into you app functionality from modules, such as Validation, Java, Spring,
and OAuth.
* xref:about-components.adoc[Core Components]: Configure flow control,
error handling, logging, batch, and other operations into your app.
* xref:dataweave.adoc[DataWeave]: Access and transform data that travels
through a Mule app using the DataWeave expression language.

You can secure your Mule apps by encrypting properties, configuring secure
communications over TLS, setting up authentication over OAuth 2.0, and providing
cryptographic and other capabilities, such as FIPS compliance.

[[flows]]
=== Flows

Understanding basic flow architecture is key to understanding Mule.
Essentially, every Mule flow contains a series of components that
receive or process messages.

Within a Mule app, Mule components and connectors are arranged into one or
more container-like components, called flows.

.Simple Flow in Design Center
image::flow-example.png[Simple Flow in Design Center]

At the simplest level, flows are sequences of Event processors. A message
that enters a flow can pass through a variety of processors. In a typical
flow, a Mule app receives a message through an Event source (such as an
HTTP listener), transforms that message into a new format, and processes
any business logic before writing the processed message to an external
system in a format that the system can read.

To break up processing into more manageable units, Mule apps often contain
multiple, interrelated flows, instead of just a single flow. A flow can call
another flow as a direct reference.

=== Event Sources

An Event source (or trigger) is the first component in a flow. It
receives a triggering event, creates a corresponding Mule event object,
and forwards that event on for processing by the next component in the flow.

External clients can trigger processing in a Mule flow through a number of
communication protocols and methods, such as JMS, HTTP, FTP, JDBC, or File.
Mule translates these communication protocols and methods into a standard
message format, which passes through the flow's Event processors.

Event sources in Mule can connect to specific external sources, either through
a standard protocol or a third-party API. It is also possible to set a Scheduler component.
Some schedulers can poll for specific changes to external resources, such as new files
or table rows in an external resource. Examples of listeners and connector operations
that can trigger a flow include:

* HTTP, JMS, VM listeners in their associated connectors
* On Table Row operation in the Database connector
* On New or Updated File operation in the File and FTP connectors
* Scheduler

Note that you can also create your own Event source using the
xref:mule-sdk::index.adoc[Mule SDK].

=== Event Processors

Once a flow is triggered through an Event source, subsequent components process
the Mule event as it travels through the flow. By default, each Event processor
that receives a Mule event returns a new Mule message, typically with a set
of attributes and the message payload that the processor returns. The processor
passes on the new message as output to the next processor in the flow.

Event processors available to Mule apps include:

* Operations from modules and connectors. Examples include reading from and
writing to an external resource and validating data in the Mule app.
+
Some operations can make client requests to external resources and services
(including external databases and systems, such as Salesforce, Workday,
ServiceNow, and many others) and to other Mule apps. Others can run your
custom code, support OAuth configurations, and handle communication through
asynchronous queues, for example. A variety of other operations are
available.
+
* Core components can route data, perform data transformations, handle errors
that might occur when processing the event, and perform other tasks in a
Mule app.
+
Transformers (such as the Transform Message, Set Variable, and others) are
key to exchanging data between nodes. Transformers enable Mule to convert
message data in the Mule event to a format that another app or service can
read.
+
Mule also enables content enrichment of messages (through
xref:target-variables.adoc[Target Parameters]) so that you can retrieve
additional data and attach it to the message.

Note that you can also create your own Event processors using the
xref:mule-sdk::index.adoc[Mule SDK].

== Property Placeholders, TBD

TODO: TBD

Mule applications support the use of property placeholders, system properties,
secure configuration properties ... Can also set

* Environment variables for shared resources in a Mule domain
* Global settings for Mule applications, such as default transaction timeout
or default error handler
* Custom provider of configuration properties

ALREADY MENTIONED IN OVERVIEW
== Development Environments

You can develop a Mule application using
xref:docs-studio::index.adoc[Anypoint Studio] (an Eclipse-based IDE),
xref:docs-design-center::about-designing-a-mule-application.adoc[Flow Designer]
(a Cloud-based application in Design Center, on Anypoint Platform),
or, if you are an advanced developer, in your own IDE.

For example, in Studio, you build and design a Mule application in a project
that contains one or more an XML-based files. A Mule project supports all the
dependencies required for development. The
xref:7.3@docs-studio::index.adoc#package-explorer[Package Explorer] in Studio
provides access to the project folders and files that make up a Mule project
support a design-time environment in which you can also build, run, and test
your Mule app. Flow Designer supports a Cloud-based version of a Mule project.
