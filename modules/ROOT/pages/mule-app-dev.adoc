Mule applications enable you to perform data integrations for your use cases.
Typical Mule applications read data from internal and external sources,
process and transform data to the required formats and structures, and
write that output to the systems and servers where you store and use the
transformed data.

//TITLE TBD:
== Mule Applications

You can start a Mule app with or without an API specification, connect to
external data sources using connectors, process your data with Core components,
and create other configurations you need to complete your application.

* xref:mule-application-about.adoc[Mule Apps]:
Learn basic Mule concepts.
* xref:about-mule-configuration.adoc[Mule Configuration]: Understand the XML
structure and configurations of Mule apps, domains used for sharing resources
between Mule apps, and policies used to enforce security, access, traffic,
and so on.
* xref:docs-connectors::index.adoc[Connectors and Modules]:
Interact with external API endpoints using pre-built Anypoint connectors, and
build in functionality from modules, such as Validation, Java, Spring, OAuth,
into your app.
* xref:about-components.adoc[Core Components]: Configure flow control,
error handling, logging, batch, and other operations into your app.
* xref:dataweave.adoc[DataWeave]: Access and transform data that travels
through a Mule app using the DataWeave expression language.
* xref:securing.adoc[Security]: Secure your Mule apps by encrypting
properties, configuring secure communications over TLS, setting up
authentication over OAuth 2.0, and providing cryptographic and other
capabilities, such as FIPS compliance.

You can also build Mule REST or SOAP APIs from an API specification using
xref:apikit/4.x/overview-4.adoc[APIKit], and your Mule app can incorporate a
connector, such as the Web Service Consumer connector or HTTP connector, that
consumes API data. You can also use incorporate connectors that are available
from Anypoint Exchange or use the Mule SDK to develop your own connector.

* xref:build-application-from-api.adoc[Build an Application from an API]
* xref:consume-data-from-an-api.adoc[Consume Data from an API]

== Development Environments

You can develop a Mule application using
xref:docs-studio::index.adoc[Anypoint Studio] (an Eclipse-based IDE),
xref:docs-design-center::about-designing-a-mule-application.adoc[Flow Designer]
(a Cloud-based application in Design Center, on Anypoint Platform),
or, if you are an advanced developer, in your own IDE.

For example, in Studio, you build and design a Mule application in a project
that contains one or more an XML-based files. A Mule project supports all the
dependencies required for development. The
xref:7.3@docs-studio::index.adoc#package-explorer[Package Explorer] in Studio
provides access to the project folders and files that make up a Mule project
support a design-time environment in which you can also build, run, and test
your Mule app. Flow Designer supports a Cloud-based version of a Mule project.


== Tutorials

These tutorials show a basic Hello World application concepts and a more
complex integration application that transforms the data it receives over a
database connection.

Can we fit in the concepts PLG mentioned?

* Interact with external API endpoints using pre-built Mule connectors [LINK_OUT]
or through API specifications that you import and integrate into the app [LINK_OUT].
//The specification defines operations to perform with API endpoints. Query params,
// headers. Making calls to a secured or unsecured API (or secured API proxy to
//which you can apply SLA policies, such as rate limiting).
// Terminology:
//   API Portal & API Console in Exchange, Mocking Service, Runtime Manager, API Manager (for proxy)

* Manipulate and process the data using Mule components [LINK] and the DataWeave
programming language [LINK_OUT].

// examples?
//Log event data.
//• Debug Mule applications.
//• Read and write event properties.
//• Write expressions with the DataWeave expression language.
//• Create variables

* Secure the data [LINK_OUT].

* Test??






//You can make calls to secure and unsecured APIs.
//example ProgrammableWeb API directory: http://www.programmableweb.com/.
// API Portal for API used in tutorial.

//NOTE: The first tricky thing is to indicate that we're focusing on topics that
//Plan: outline the basic pieces of app dev. Link out to topics in other repos that
//cover pieces not covered in the Mule Runtime section.
