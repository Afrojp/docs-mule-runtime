MuleSoft supports three different deployment targets: CloudHub, Anypoint Runtime Fabric, and on-premises Mule instances.

All Mule Applications are deployed to a Mule runtime engine instance. However, depending on the deployment target you chose, the management of the Mule instance changes and the tools available to deploy applications differ:
