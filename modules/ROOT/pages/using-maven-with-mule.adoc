Maven is a project management utility that Mule implements to enhance project development. Mule provides built-in Maven functionality, including the following features:

* Anypoint Exchange
** Connectors in Anypoint Exchange provide Maven dependency information. In Anypoint Exchange, you can click a connector asset and click *Dependency Snippets* to list the Maven `pom.xml` file dependency.
* Anypoint Studio
** All new projects created in Anypoint Studio 7 and later are configured with Maven by default. You can run the project with Maven from the command line, or run it directly from Anypoint Studio.
** You can import an existing Maven project into Anypoint Studio and continue working on it. See xref:studio::import-export-packages.adoc[Importing and Exporting Projects] for more details.
* Mule Runtime Engine
** You can integrate the packaging, testing, and deployment of your Mule applications with your Maven lifecycle using the xref:mmp-concept.adoc[Mule Maven plugin].

== Prerequisites

This document assumes that you are familiar with Maven, managing pom.xml files, and working with Maven plugins. If you are just getting started with Maven, we suggest you follow http://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/[Maven's Getting Started tutorial].


== Benefits

 Maven can facilitate the management of your Mule applications both inside and outside of Anypoint Studio, providing these benefits:

* When you create a new Mule project using Studio, you can be confident that you are working with the correct Mule project folder structure and basic set of standard dependencies.
* Studio automatically manages your POM file every time you add new elements to your flow that require additional dependencies.
* The Maven POM file makes sharing projects easier and more lightweight, because the POM references the dependencies so that you don't have to manually find and include every dependency within the project itself.
* Using Maven to manage the builds ensures that the resulting final build is sanitized and standardized.
* You can program automatic builds using external frameworks such as bamboo for continuous integration.

== Options for Using Maven with Mule

Depending on where you are with your project and what your goals are, you can:

* **Build and run a new Maven project in Anypoint Studio.** All new projects created on Studio are configured with Maven by default. You can then run the project with Maven from the command line, or run it directly from Studio. See xref:6@studio::building-a-mule-application-with-maven-in-studio.adoc[Building a Mule Application with Maven in Studio] for a step-by-step guide demonstrating how to create, manage, and run a Mule project with Maven.

* **Import an existing Maven project into Studio.** If you already have a Maven project you want to work on further with Studio, you can import it easily. Access xref:6@studio::importing-a-maven-project-into-studio.adoc[Importing a Maven Project into Studio] for details.

== Tips

* **Use Studio:** Studio's built-in Maven support minimizes the chance that you would have to manually update your POM file with new dependencies as you add to, or modify your applications.   +

* **Update your POM file and settings.xml if necessary:** If you create Maven projects from the command line using archetypes, you need to manage your POM file manually, and in some cases, adjust your `settings.xml` file to point to the MuleSoft Enterprise repository and supply credentials. In some cases, even if you manage your project with Studio, you may need to make manual adjustments to your POM as well. +

* *SNAPSHOT version:* Use SNAPSHOT to identify versions of your project as you work toward producing a stable product you intend to release. For example, you can build a 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT version of your project, test functionality, make changes etc. until you are ready to release it as version 1.0.0. Then you can build upon using a new version, 1.1.0-SNAPSHOT.
