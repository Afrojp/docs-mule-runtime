You can use the Mule Maven Plugin to package your application into a deployable JAR file that you can later deploy to a running Mule Runtime.

. Make sure you added the Mule Maven Plugin to your `pom.xml` file.
. From the command line in your project's folder, run the package goal:
+
[source,console,linenums]
----
> mvn clean package
----

The packager then packages your application and creates the deployable JAR file into the target directory within your project's folder. +

==== Import Your Generated JAR to Anypoint Studio.

If you want to import your generated JAR into Anypoint Studio, you need to package your application using the `-DattachMuleSources` option.

[source,console,linenums]
----
> mvn clean package -DattachMuleSources
----

The `-DattachMuleSources` argument tells the packager to add a mule-src folder inside the META-INF directory with an exact copy of your application structure at design time.

==== Generate a Lightweight Package.

If you want to create a lightweight package, you need to package your application using the `-DlightweightPackage` option.

[source,console,linenums]
----
> mvn clean package -DlightweightPackage
----

A lightweight package does not contain all the application's dependencies. These are just declared so that the other components obtain the JAR files. +

[TIP]
Lightweight packages should be used only to reduce the application's weight for sharing purposes. You should not deploy lightweight packages.
